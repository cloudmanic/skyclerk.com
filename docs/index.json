[{"categories":["Spotlight"],"contents":"  Bowling has been a popular pastime for families, friends, and people of all ages since the late 1800s. It’s no secret that they are a fun place to sit around, hang out, drink, and play a few games. Others take it more seriously and enjoy some friendly competition with other competitors. Tigard Bowl, located off Highway 99 in Tigard, OR has provided a fun and energetic environment for all types of bowlers for over 60 years. The Basics: Owners: Mark Pearl and wife Lori Pearl Location: 11660 SW Pacific Highway Portland, OR 97223\nPhone: 503 639 2001 Cost: $3.25 per game Number of Lanes: 14 The Approach:  Approach– The act of taking steps towards the lane before rolling the ball; also the name of the area directly behind the foul line that contains three sets of dots used for lining up of the feet. (Learn more about mastering the bowling approach.)   Mark Pearl, the owner of Tigard Bowl, wasn’t always interested in bowling. He began work in the labor industry at a young age and did it for about 30 years. While he enjoyed the work he did, there came a time when he realized he couldn’t do manual labor forever. His wife, Lori Pearl, had a family business in the area, and eventually the couple were asked if they would like to get involved. The business had been around since 1954 and was a staple of the community. Mark saw this as an opportunity and countered with the idea of them owning the entire place. Soon after, he and his wife owned Tigard Bowl. Once they had control over the alley, Mark decided it was time that he learned how to really bowl, and since then he has been in love with the sport and the people it attracts. Mark has now been bowling regularly for almost 30 years! He is even a participant in five different bowling leagues. The Count:  While bowling alleys may not be considered large money makers, Mark and his wife have turned Tigard Bowl into a unique environment where the profit comes strictly from bowling and not gimmicky arcade games. While some money does come from the food and full bar that they offer, its the bowling that keeps them afloat.   Tigard Bowl offers a variety of bowling related services, such as shoe and ball rental, pro shop work, and a great lane machine that makes sure the floor always has the perfect amount of oil. On top of that, Pearl is consistently offering free bowling lessons and tips as well as hosting many league tournaments and events. His league bowlers know better than anyone that the regulars can make or break a business. Most of the profit comes from his league bowlers, as they come in consistently each week and he knows he can depend on them. The Bagger:  Tigard Bowl really isn’t your average alley. While the same general services are offered, the atmosphere and sense of community helps this place top all the others. Mark Pearl and his wife, as well as kids, are very involved in the day to day operations. They spend most of their time in their alley, whether they are fixing things, helping at registers, or engaging with customers.  From the second you walk into the building, you can tell that Mark Pearl really cares about his business and everyone that comes into it. He is a very social man, and genuinely enjoys conversing with everyone whether it's about bowling or one of his band’s gigs.  Mark is always excited to give pointers as well. He gives many free lessons and often joins in on games, helping him to connect with regulars and newcomers alike. Tigard Bowl is the place where you stop for a drink and a quick game and stay for the new friends and good hard laughs. If you go once, you will most certainly want to go back soon. You Can’t Split the Friendships Here:  Ever since Mark took over the alley, the community has grown bigger and bigger. Many of the league bowlers have become friends for life, and the Tigard Bowl staff is glad to be a part of that.  One man has been bowling there for years. He is 93 years old, has been in the men’s league for somewhere near 50 years, has bowled in two different upper level competitive leagues, and he consistently shoots 200 point games. He has a strong love for bowling, and Pearl likes to joke that the game is what keeps him going.  Another woman, Cheryl Drake, met her late husband at Tigard Bowl. She was bowling on a Saturday night for Monte Carlo. Back in 1992 scoringwas done by hand, and Cheryl was still learning how to do it. That night a man named Bill sat down on lane 10 and explained to her the process, and that was the beginning of their relationship. They ended up being married for almost 21 years before Bill passed.  “I was bowling as a sub on Bill’s team and threw a 242 scratch and Bill struck out just to tie me! Everyone gave him [a hard time] for not letting me win, but in the end we were on the same team that night! He always loved a good fight!”  Mark Pearl himself has made numerous friends through his business, which is a large part of why he is so passionate about his alley. He met his two best friends through bowling at his center and he is now on teams with the two of them (excluding COVID times).  \"It’s part of what draws you to keep going back to Tigard Bowl! I have many friends from there to this day!\"\" -Cheryl Drake  Covid Strikes Down the Alley:  When COVID-19 hit, Tigard Bowl was fully shut down. Thinking it would all be overwish in a month or two, Mark Pearl kept all of the employees fully on payroll for over 4 months, using PPP loans from the government to help him afford it. While they couldn’t open to the public, many of the employees came in to help clean. After two months the loans ended, but Mark kept his employees under payroll for another two and a half months before having to lay off employees. They were closed for a full 7 months, with no income. Just to keep the building shut down it cost him and his family around $20,000 per month! They spent up to $250,000 out of pocket since closed, just trying to keep things ready and help employees as much as possible. They lost almost everything and would’ve had to close permanently if they hadn’t opened by November.  Mark knew they had to take action unless they wanted to lose the iconic business Tigard Bowl had become. On the verge of bankruptcy, he asked the close friends he had made over the years to help spread the word. They began having protests on Saturdays, asking everyone to send letters to various officials, reaching out to the news channels and the Oregonian, etc. Most importantly, he made sure to spread the word that he genuinely wants to keep customers safe by any means possible.  Before even re opening, Mark had taken extensive measures to make sure he was prepared. He devised a plan to keep everyone socially distanced, purchased large amounts of cleaning supplies, and installed two plastic 6x6 panels between each lane. Mark Pearl was ready to open and determined to make it happen fast. Community Pulled them from the Gutter:  While Mark Pearl himself moved mountains to reopen his alley, it was the amazing support from his bowling community and the bonds they had made that got Tigard Bowl open again on October 22nd. Many friends and bowlers had come together to support the business and help send letters, protest, create fundraisers and gofundme pages, and just spread the word. During their final demonstration out along the highway, Pearl received a call with the great news. Effective immediately, the “phase 1.5” revision allowed for the alley to re-open as soon as they could get everything in order.  Tigard Bowl was officially reopened the next day- October 23rd, 2020. Though they are finally ready for bowlers, they have had to adapt to follow the new COVID procedures. There will be one entrance and one exit. Upon entering for your reserved time, you will be given gloves to use while you find a ball that fits, that way you can try them all out. Then you’ll take the gloves with you to your lane, receive sanitized rental shoes, and be able to bowl. Your lane will be divided from the next and you will be required to wear a mask at all times. When you are done you’ll leave your balls, gloves and shoes there so that an employee can go sanitize them and anything else you may have touched. Hours have also had to change, and any other rules and regulations they will comply with can be found on the Oregon Health Authority site. The 10th Frame:  After a long fight, Mark Pearl is very excited to have his alley back open. He has lots of time to make up for and intends to start bringing the bowling community back together right away. Hopefully with a few more adjustments he will be also to get the leagues going again and maybe even rebuild their savings. He and his family would love any support you can give them and hope to see you in for some lessons!

Located in Hillsboro, Oregon, Danny has recently started his own personal training company called Blake’s Health and Fitness.    How He Got Started:  Daniel Blake started his fitness training journey while he served in the Marines. He was a certified HITT instructor, and he also PT’s his Marines. While he was enlisted, the idea of being a trainer came up and it grew on him the more he thought about it. His next job in the fitness industry was working for a gym, which was located out in Phoenix, AZ. Once he had the job as a trainer, he began to love it more and more. It really didn’t take Danny long to realize that personal training was a career he would love to do long term. Schooling and Certification:  Before starting Blake’s Health and Fitness, Daniel had to figure out exactly what kind of business he wanted and how he wanted to run it, as well as how big or small he wanted to start, how he wanted to train others, etc. After deciding on his personal training business, he got certifications through USMC HITT and NCCP. He is currently attending Portland State University for applied health and fitness with a minor in business administration, and he has hundreds of OJT (on the job training) hours as a trainer. He has been certified through USMC HITT since 2015 and through NCCPT since 2018, meaning he has years of official experience. How His Business Works:  Blake’s personal training isn’t just about lifting weights. He says that “there is much more to being fit and living a healthy lifestyle than just working with a trainer a few times a week.” Committing to real change means that you need to change all of your bad habits. You have to assess everything you put into your body as well as work hard- with or without your trainer present. Hiring a personal trainer is just a start, as you have to be willing to put in the hard work. Starting at a rate of $60 per hour, Daniel offers all of the following services: assessments, a personalized fitness plan, personal training, group sessions, and lots of motivation! He has also recently implemented an inexpensive motivational training program, in which he won’t train a person, but he checks in with them on assigned days to hold them accountable and make sure they are doing what they should be fitness wise. Who He Trains:  Before accepting a client, each one is carefully and personally screened by Danny to ensure that they can safely and effectively exercise without causing harm to themselves or others. Questions are asked about everything from their lifestyle, health history, and general health and habits. He also asks about their goalsand timeline to help build the best personal routine he can. Blake’s Health and Fitness takes people of all shapes, sizes, backgrounds and fitness levels. He has plenty of experience with the average parent, college student, etc. He has also had some elderly clients struggling to climb stairs on a daily basis, and he was able to adapt to the needs of every client. What Type of Workouts He Does:  Depending on the clients needs, you may work in a lifting style gym, a more open style gym, or just outside at a local park. Sessions will typically last around an hour, but the frequency varies depending on the client’s goals and needs. Depending on the needs of the client, some of them may be lifting heavy, some may be working mobility, some may be doing aggressive HITT. During a session, he will go over his client’s basic health to make sure they don’t have any injuries or health issues that will hinder them during a workout. The program is always tailored to each client, as nobody has the exact same goals, limitations, or abilities. For those who don’t like to work out alone, Blake also offers group fitness sessions. Though groups have to remain small as of now, due to COVID-19, they are still a great way to stay motivated and enjoy your workouts more!  When entering a session, clients should expect to work- and work hard! Daniel pushes his clients hard so that they can safely reach new peaks. It doesn’t matter how in or out of shape you are; his sessions will push you everytime, and quitting isn’t something you do at Blake’s Health and Fitness. Daniel cares deeply about each of his clients, and that’s why he will go to great lengths to help you reach your goals and feel good about the work you do. What His Style Is Like:  Daniel’s style is all about balance. His logo is a modified Yin Yang symbol for that specific reason. In order to be happy and healthy, you need a balance between things like work and life, working out and eating, activity and sleeping, etc. Danny understands that it can be hard to keep balance between all of these things when we lead such busy lives, but it is possible. There is a perfect balance to be found, and his goal is to help you find it. Blake uses a strategic and aggressive fitness routine that will encourage positive change in all balances in one’s life.  Danny will be inspiring, but also works hard to push you. There are no excuses and there is no laziness. Clients should expect to put in 100% and sweat a ton. No matter what your limitations are, Blake will always find a way to work around them. He enjoys seeing his clients grow every session, as well as seeing them happy about new achievements and milestones. Not only does he push hard, but Daniel also brings loads of positivity and motivation to every session to help get his clients to these goals.  He also encourages all of his clients to record their progress- not only how they look, but  how they feel and what they can physically do. He will also be recording such progress on all clients as he meets with them each time. He uses this progress to keep clients moving forward during times when some may not feel like putting in the hard work. No matter what, hsi custom programs will be moving his clients towards their goals at all times.   How COVID-19 Has Had an Effect on His Business:  As a personal trainer, Daniel has lots of experience in health and fitness, but as the owner of his own small business, he also has to understand the business and marketing side of things. While starting your own company is already hard enough as is, Blake has had to deal with COVID-19 in addition to all the other struggles new businesses often face. “Starting out with no clients and slowly building that relationship, trust, and passion for changing one’s life” is much more difficult with COVID-19 standing in the way of more personal interactions, he says.  Blake’s Health and Fitness launched in February 2020, and quarantine went into effect in March. Because of this, it has been even more difficult than usual for Daniel to get the ball rolling. Even now that quarantine is starting to end, people are still worried about being in contact with others, especially in a fitness setting, so things are going to be challenging this year. He is for sure going to have to change the way he planned on doing business. How He Has Adapted:  In such difficult times, Daniel Blake had to be smart about how he began his work and turned to social media. He is usingfacebook and instagram to connect with friends, potential clients and other professionals in the field to get the word out that Blake’s Health and Fitness is up and running. Many of his friends and clients help spread the word as well, both over social media and through word of mouth! He is very active on social media and there are also plans in the works for PR style events that will allow people to work with him and get a feel for how he does business at Blakes Health and Fitness.  His business is fairly new and still on the rise, but Daniel’s passion for fitness and helping others is sure to make his training very successful! Though he has many challenges to face with the current public health situation, Danny’s creativity has been utilized and I am confident that he will make things work out in the end. If you are looking for a great trainer who understands balance, hard work, and positive motivation, then give Blake’s Health and Fitness a call!

They have taken advantage of their large, 7.5 acre property to build their very own family run haunted house- Milburn’s Haunted Manor. How It All Began  A while back, Mike took his family on a relaxing vacation to Mexico. They enjoyed themselves so much that they knew they had to go back. In order to do that, however, they needed some extra vacation funds. Being both a fan and a critic of haunted houses himself, Mike decided their property would work perfectly for their very own! \"At the time, our two kids were involved in the high school drama club. We thought ‘let’s run a little haunted house.’ We figured the drama club could use it as a fundraiser and we could have a little vacation fund generator. It worked. The haunted house has sent us on many-a-vacation to many-a-cool-place over the years. Sometimes when a few of us are out working on the haunts during the hot summer, we remind each other of the cool pool and slushy drinks the haunt will be providing.\" Since then, the Milburns have had a lot of fun getting friends and volunteers together to scare as a group. If it weren’t for COVID, October 2020 would have been the 18th year running.\nAll Inclusive Night of Horror Milburn’s Haunted Manor is located in Hubbard, OR. Because it is a bit more out of the way, about half an hour from Portland or Salem, they wanted to make it more of a destination. That is why they have two haunts, full concession and Moonlit Pumpkin Patch. \"Having two haunts has benefits logistically as well. You do not have to stand in line as long since there are two haunts to dilute the lines. Also, I try to employ different scaring techniques in the two haunts. If we didn’t get you in the Manor we might in the Dark,\" Mike says.\nThe Two Haunts: Milburn’s Haunted Manor The manor is very theatrical, as it emulates the classic style of a horror movie haunted house. It features One Eyed Suzie as their mascot. She is a little doll that Mike found years ago. She has a burnt out eye socket and stringy hair, and she only stands about 30 inches tall. She is seriously creepy looking and is definitely not the kind of doll you want in your nursery. She is great nightmare fuel! \"Sometimes when I’m working out in the haunt and I see little Suzie out of the corner of my eye she gets me to jump. For fun we like to include her in the background of any pictures we use. Not easy to see but always there somewhere.\" Their haunted story or theme each year for the Manor always includes little Suzie Milburn and some story about her murdering her family many years ago. And that is why this place is haunted.\nThe manor also includes a generic house layout; a living room, hallways with some lovely paintings, a few zombies, a dining room, a kitchen, an axe murderer, a bedroom, etc. You certainly can’t forget the backyard, complete with a broken down truck and some massive spiders! The Haunts: The Dark  \"The Dark is more lighting effects and startle scares. Due to the low light visibility, if you’re afraid of the dark… I’m going to ring your bell. Claustrophobic people also seem to have problems with the Dark (in a good, scary way).\"\n As the name clearly states, this haunt is pretty dark inside. In fact, it’s pitch black. With the exception of a few flashing lights and some smokey green lazers, youll have to feel your way through this maze of fear. Be ready for zombies, chainsaws, dead bodies, and lots of jump scares!\nThe Graveside Grill  Everybody knows that the best part of fall is the food, but the Milburn’s and their amazing team of cooks take their scary snacks to the next level! The Graveside Grill offers carnival style foods, complete with items like fresh cut curly fries, hot dogs and the most unique, mouth watering chili dogs. And what would a concession stand be without dessert? They offer treats such as zombie donuts (made to order) and funnel fried bacon that their volunteers just can’t get enough of! To complete any meal you get, they also have choices between water, pop, hot chocolate, and a steaming hot apple silver that resembles a sour apple candy.\nThe Moonlit Pumpkin Patch  Last but not least, they have a moonlit pumpkin patch near the picnic tables, so that you can really get the most of your night in Hubbard. Their guests can come to Milburn’s to get scared at our two haunts, have some awesome eats and pick up a Milburn’s grown pumpkin, all in one visit. Best of all, the pumpkins are very affordable! Even the largest of them all is only $6. Why Milburn’s Is Special  Their goal is to make the guest feel like they are in a scary movie. They strive for the term they have coined\"haunted theatre.\" Most haunts are designed for high throughput, as more tickets sold means more cash flow. But haunts that push too many guests through are reduced to mostly \"jump out – go boo\" type scares. You also end up too close to other groups, making you miss a scare altogether. At Milburn’s, they limit the number of ticket sales each night so they can integrate good theatre and jump scares into each and every room and create a more personal experience for each group. Why It’s Scarier  Over the years they developed techniques on how to design scares that really spook you. Once you understand the mechanics of scaring people and the science behind it, then it becomes pretty easy to design rooms with the potential to scare. This also makes it easier to pick an actor that will best fit the room and bring the fear to life. The best room design will fall flat with a weak actor, so it’s important to design for \"ease of scare\" and the actor doesn’t get burned out too fast. After all, on a busy night that actor will have to repeat that scare every minute and a half, and acting like a zombie for hours on end will really ‘drain the life out of you.’ But how does Mike keep it interesting? Well, he makes some small (or sometimes very large) changes every year, whether it's a whole new room or just a new theme. While you’d think it would be hard to constantly come up with new ideas, Mike can find inspiration just about anywhere.\n\"Sometimes I see a Youtube video prank and it gets me thinking about how I could turn that into a scare. Sometimes it’s a scary movie. Sometimes at other haunts. Yep, we all steal each other’s ideas. I’ll even call up another haunt owner to pick his brain on how he built a prop. We of course try to put our own personal twist on the scare to make it our own. I’ve been on a ride in Disneyland that inspired an idea for a room in my haunt. When you do this for a living you keep an eye out for interesting angles or effects.\" So even if you went the year before, beware! You may think you’re prepared, but Mike Milburn always has something creepy and crawly up his sleeve!\nThe Accomplishments  Nobody is more humble about the success of the haunt than it’s creator, Mike. Milburn’s Haunted Manor is a truly unique haunted house that is almost guaranteed to make you scream. It has been recognized as the #1 Scariest Haunt by OregonHauntedHouses.com, has won other awards, and has been featured by both OPB and the Oregonian. However, Mike doesn’t care about the labels or titles; he just genuinely enjoys the community of volunteers, family, and excited guests. \"We’ve received some great awards and even some national recognition. Those are cool but it is hearing from our guests that is the real payoff. I love to be out front and talk to the guests and listen to them laugh about getting scared. I love hearing about how we have become a seasonal family tradition for so many people. It’s what drives us to be the best we can be.\"\nWhat If You Want To Volunteer?  In order to volunteer on your own you need to be at least 15 and minors must have a parent waiver signed. Anyone younger is welcome as long as parents participate as well. Anyone over the age of 18 must pass a background test. No previous experience is needed, as they do a training night for anyone who wants to be in the haunt.\nTheir staffing coordinator meets with each volunteer and determines what they would be good at. Some are obviously outgoing and great for very visible acting roles. Others are not so outgoing but that’s okay because there are plenty of behind the scenes rolls in a haunt, much like a play. There are 3 stage hands to every actor. If you want to volunteer, they will find a fit for you.\nWhy Volunteer? The short answer- it’s just plain fun! There is no better way to experience and embrace Halloween than to make a 40 year old man drop to his knees, crying in fear. There’s nothing better than watching a 6 year old boy walk through without hesitation while his mother shakes in terror. And there’s no way you can go home in a bad mood after successfully scaring hundreds of people in just one night. At Milburn’s Haunted Manor you get to do that. There are many times after a scare, when the guests have advanced out of a room, that the zombies break and laugh and high-five the ghosts across the hall before resetting for the next group. It is so addicting and so much fun to be a part of a haunt. Once you try it, you won’t be able to stop!\nFor the actors and techs, they have a hospitality tent where they provide free dinner each night. Pizza, sandwiches, water, pop, snacks, and more. They want to fuel their volunteers up each night before the show. They also provide cough drops and water, as they know how tiring it can be! All volunteers will also get a Milburn’s Crew t-shirt each year. Those who volunteer more nights get a Milburn’s hat. They also hand out coupons each night for free munchies at the concession stand for those who want some deep fried goodies. Because of all the delicious snacks, by the end of October the skeletons finally have a little meat on their bones!\nFAQ What Kind of People Do You See Go Through The Haunt?\n\"We are a PG13 haunt so we discourage young kids. However it is up to the parent to decide if their child is able to handle it. I’ve seen 10 year olds go through it fine. I’ve seen 10 year olds bail out crying. It depends on the kid. That’s why we let the Parent or guardian decide. We see plenty of seniors. Of course our main age group is young adults. Pretty much, we appeal to ‘the roller coaster crowd.’ People who like the thrill of being scared and the fun of a good scream.\"\nWho are your returning volunteers? Can you tell me a little about some of them?\n\"We have a few ‘hard core’ repeat volunteers that just keep coming back for more year after year. They make up about 30% of our volunteers.\n\"We have a mother / daughter team that has been coming for about 10 years because they love being involved. They love the seasonal carnival feel of the place. Funny thing is, they don’t even like to scare that much. They love doing the ticket line and interacting with our guests.\n\"Of course we have the group that just loves scaring people and they look forward to the season every year. We’ve even had some kids from clubs that have grown up, moved away or gone off to war and have come back to this area. They show up to sign ups and we get to laugh about the ‘old days’.\n\"It gets in their blood. If you haven’t really made someone fall to the ground screaming, you wouldn’t understand. But they come back all grown up and volunteer because it was such a fun part of their youth.\n\"We do have one guy who has been with us every year we’ve been open. All 17 years. Every year he says that it’s his last but when sign ups come around he shows up. Scaring people, or ‘melting em down’ as we call it is addicting. A hard habit to kick. When the leaves start falling you start to feel the itch.\"\nHow many people do you generally see through the haunt in one night?\n\"An average night is 600 to 800 guests. But, the place really gets hopping on the Saturday before Halloween. You’d think Halloween would be our biggest night but no. It’s the Saturday before that we sell out the fastest.\"\nWho does the makeup?\n\"My Son Ethan Milburn is the head of our makeup department. He’s been doing for most of our 18 years. I was happy to hand it over to him. He’s incredibly talented and he’s pretty much taught himself most of what he knows. I make sure to send him to a class or seminar at the local haunted house convention, but in truth he rarely learns anything he didn’t already know. Each year he assembles a small group of people to round out the makeup team. Just 3 or 4 of them and they can do the makeup for 40 volunteers in 40 minutes. It’s pretty impressive. The makeup team are kind of our elite players, our haunted house rock stars each season.\"\nHow long does it generally take to get through the haunt?\n\"The Manor is longer and more theatrical so it takes the longest. I’d say about 12 to 15 minutes to go through at a normal pace. The Dark is a little less.\"\nHow long do people generally wait in lines?\n\"Depends on the night you come out. Those guests who are clever come out on one of the earlier weekends and experience far shorter waits. The Saturday before Halloween… can be an hour wait per haunt. The second Sunday of October… can be as short as a 5 minute wait. My hint would be to show up right when we open. Even if it is going to be busy you’ll cut your wait time dramatically.\"\nDo you build everything yourself?\n\"Yep, I’m the plumber, the electrician, the painter, grounds, construction, everything. Haunters have to be 90% MacGyver. I have a team of friends that help build it but it falls to mostly me. Every now and then I get some help from our haunt volunteers. Usually it’s the ones that just can’t wait for the season to start so they show up to help get it off the ground. Love those people.\"\nCan you tell me some fun/crazy stories from running the haunt?\n\"One year during a slow time (not many guests on site) I was working the crowd and ended up talking to this woman. She said she had two kids in the car that were too scared to go into the haunts. In fact they didn’t want to even get out of the car. So I called my zombies to make their way through the parking lot and attack the car. We called it a \"zombie bomb\". The Mother thought it was fantastic and I am certain that we are one of their favorite seasonal family stories. Those kids were totally freaked out. It was the beginning of many a zombie bomb. When it would get slow….zombie bomb.\"\nWhat happens if you get too scared during the haunt?\n\"Per code, there are emergency exits every 50ft of travel through the haunts. It is easy to bail at any of these. In a room if you raise your hand and yield our actors will back off. When we see someone no longer having fun we back off.

Business owners especially are scrambling to take care of themselves, their kids, and their businesses—and there doesn’t seem to be enough time or resources to go around or an end to this madness anywhere in sight.  These entrepreneurs, whose lives were already challenging before this pandemic, have experienced even more hurdles as their kids went from being in school most of the week to those same kids learning and being at home all the time. Parents all over the US are juggling work and life already, but now they’re adding full-time teaching and IT support to their virtual-learning school-aged kids. And, guess what? It’s not going super well.\nWhy Efficient Homeschooling Is Important for Business Owners Right Now  While I’m not a parent to any tiny humans at the moment (although I am a dog mom to two rambunctious bulldogs), I’ve heard stories from my solopreneur colleagues and co-workers about the ups and downs of parenting during this pandemic. And I empathize—I know how important it is for children everywhere to receive a good, comprehensive education.  Early childhood education is especially important because this is when children first learn how to interact with the people around them. It’s when they learn the basic skills they need for life, like reading and math, but it’s also when they start to develop their own interests.   Before the pandemic, putting kids in school yielded many more advantages than giving entrepreneurial parents breathing room to get work done. It was great to send children to a place that taught consistently and effectively, with a standardized curriculum. And perhaps most importantly, those teachers went to school to train to be great teachers and work with students. Before COVID-19, parents had peace of mind knowing that their school-going children were being given a quality education.  In a world of uncertainty and chaos, a steady education can provide some semblance of normalcy. While we can’t control much in this pandemic, we can try to control the caliber of education that children get during this time. Back to School in a Pandemic: 6 Homeschooling Tips for Business-Owning Parents  If 2020 was your first exposure to homeschooling, it probably seemed overwhelming. Even virtual learning presents additional work and stress to working parents, despite having a teacher on the other side of the screen. Luckily, there are tons of helpful resources available online to help you get started. You can also tap into the resources you already have to make the best of a murky situation.   I wanted to help make the teaching journeys of business-owning parents a little easier, so I did the research and compiled some homeschooling tips below. 1. Pool Your Resources  When you realize everyone else is in the same boat, you find new and innovative ways to collaborate. Although avoiding large groups and practicing social distancing is important in this pandemic, there are still ways to safely gather and learn together.  For instance, look at Spicer Matthews, the founder here at Skyclerk. He pooled his resources with a few families in his neighborhood to open a small school in their home and hired a teacher to oversee the pool of nine kids. In this way, the kid learn together in a small, safe environment while receiving excellent education from a professional. Additionally, this teacher can work in their chosen field with a small group of children whose parents value her expertise.  He was inspired by Jason Calacanis, a Silicon Valley investor who wants to set up a micro-school in his backyard.  Jason and Spicer’s schools are just some of the pandemic pods sweeping the nation. More efficient than one-family homeschooling, but safer than sending kids back to large schools, pandemic pods allow families to pool resources so that one parent, teacher,, or tutor can educate a small group of kids safely. 2. Keep It Consistent  For kids (and let’s face it, adults, too), consistency is key. Creating a set schedule with clear blocks of time for learning certain subjects, taking breaks, and completing homework is important to maintaining consistency and stability.  Flexibility within the schedule you create is vital, too. Make sure to reevaluate how this schedule is working for each child in your household, and refine it as needed. 3. Make It Memorable  We indeed live in a digital-first world, but sometimes, writing things down on paper is the best way to memorize facts. Luckily, Evan-Moor creates a great line of workbooks that students can use to build their knowledge.  Encouraging your child to select a blank notebook with a cover they enjoy can also help to spark their interest in continued learning. Whether that notebook features one of their favorite superheroes or is covered in glitter, allow them to choose one that will make writing down and reviewing notes from class more exciting. 4. Learn Outside the Box  Learning through unconventional methods can also help your children stay engaged with their curriculum. Podcasts, for instance, can be a great tool for teaching and engaging your kids. Older children may enjoy the Grimm, Grimmer, Grimmestfairy tale podcast by Adam Gidwitz, but you should also explore the wide world of podcasts at your fingertips to find one specific to your child’s interests.  Museums are also a great educational tool to explore with your children. If you can’t go in person, consider virtual tours. 5. Cultivate Creativity  When you’re teaching kids their required curriculum, don’t forget about creative courses, too. Explore Udemy to find courses on art, music, and more that unleash your child’s creative skills. 6. Contextualize Current Events  While history courses are important, it’s also critical to contextualize current events for your kids—after all, the current events of today are the history classes of tomorrow.  Scholastic offers affordable resources on current events that are engaging for students of many grade levels. Parenting While Self-Employed: Final Thoughts  Although parenting and working for yourself simultaneously can be a struggle, I hope these tips help you find some balance.  Together, we can all push through to make virtual schooling as valuable as in-person schooling was so that kids receive a comprehensive education while being prepared for returning to regular schooling in the future.

However, small businesses actually are a core part of our economy, probably its heart and organs, encompassing a far wider variety of products and services than those that immediately come to mind. These enterprises often derive from a dream or a personal need, and survive as long as their solution responds to other people’s needs as well. Extraordinary  Today you’ll meet a PhD lecturer from the University of Vermont, who is also a snowboarder, weightlifter, punk rocker, skateboarder, and a motorcycle aficionado. Dylan Burns is anything but ordinary - and, as you will find, neither is his business, Dbgear.  Dylan was first introduced to weight lifting at his local YMCA as part of the after school fitness program they offered when he was in 6th grade. \"This got me hooked\", he says, \"I absolutely loved the challenge of weight training.\" After that first contact, he never stopped training, and he even competed in a few powerlifting meets, NPC bodybuilding shows, and CrossFit events in his college years.   The small business he started came in response to a need he found while weightlifting. As he explains...\n \"Throughout my years of lifting, I used both prong and lever belts, but was frustrated with the limitations of adjustability, along with the fact that they could not be adjusted on-the-fly while lifting. The lever belt could only be adjusted in 1-inch increments, so many times it would be a little too loose, or a little too tight. In order to adjust this, I would need to take the belt off and unscrew the buckle, move it to the next available holes, and screw it back on\"  From the gym to the university - and vice versa  Dylan’s background in mechanical engineering, as well as his experience with snowboarding, played an important part in how he solved this problem. “In the late 2000’s I began work on my dissertation ‘Ambulatory Lordosimeter Measurement and Feedback Control of Seated Posture’.”  On his PhD, he collaborated with a medical team. They used a belt similar to a weight lifting belt to hold in place a device that measured the curvature of the patient’s lower back. Due to the importance of precise data in the research, the correct adjustment of the belt was key. “Much of the research and clinical testing that I conducted during my PhD would be what fueled my desire to develop my own lifting belt, and what would later launch the start of Dbgear.”     The belt he developed uses a ratcheting buckle, which allows for on-the-fly millimeter scale incremental adjustments in tightness. According to Dylan, the majority of current weight belts still relies on a standard adjustment of 1-inch increments. “In addition, my belts offer 1 button quick release function on the buckle, thus making it easy to take it off quickly to transition between exercises. That same ease transfers to putting it on, since the ladder strap easily feeds into a ratcheting buckle.” Maximum life and durability  Besides coming up with clever solutions, a lasting business also needs to assure the quality of the product. For Dbgear, that means belts “designed for maximum life and durability, allowing it to be taken on and off repeatedly, withstanding the wear and tear of hard gym use. Another key attribute is the minimized number of components, which keeps this lightweight belt sleek and low profile, suitable for Olympic lifting styles.”   Solving the need  Even though Dbgear’s website shows many different products, I found that Dylan’s hands - with the help of one employee - are the ones crafting the majority of his inventory.   \"I had some sewing experience that my Mom, Karen Burns, taught me when I was younger. I also learned much of the leather work from a friend of mine who was an experienced leather worker. When I decided to start making the belts myself, I contacted my friend and went back to NY to stay with him while he trained me on the basics of leather working and how to use an industrial stitching machine (Cowboy CB4500) to stitch the thick leather belts. These skills, along with a lot of trial and error, helped me to discern the best methods and materials to create quality lifting belts.\"     Even the buckles he uses are designed by him. “I am the design engineer for m2 inc, a small Vermont company that produces these buckles. I have been working with them developing and testing ratcheting buckle technology since 2008.” Dbgear, which started as a solution to flexible waist adjustment and easy set up and removal of weight belts, nowadays responds to a plethora of different needs. According to Dylan, a great part of Dbgear’s inventory additions comes from input from their customers, which has allowed them to grow and thrive, even when the surrounding circumstances aren’t that favorable. Finding new needs to solve  “Typically, we add new products and items on a monthly basis” , says Dylan. “We are constantly designing and testing new ideas and making prototypes. Many of these new ideas come from customer feedback, requests, and suggestions. We have been expanding our leather work into other areas outside of the gym and fitness community. Some of the new products include gun belts, knife sheaths, dog collars, bondage and S\u0026M gear, bags, purses, motorcycle accessories…”           From these suggestions also sprouted different products that were no longer exclusively made of leather. Keeping up with the requests meant branching out. Dylan became partners with Thomas Lowell on 2 Bros Printing, “so we are able to design and print all of our own apparel (while bringing in additional revenue by printing for other small businesses).” Even the knee sleeves and wrist wraps - which are commissioned out - have Dylan’s touch. “I did the initial design and testing for these, but they are produced by an outside manufacturer.” Thriving during hard times  Keeping up with demand also means being aware of changes in one’s surrounding. Dbgear has recently added face masks to their catalog. “Since businesses have been opening back up recently, a lot of them have been requiring their staff and/or patrons to wear masks. We have been producing several different styles of masks to help make them more readily available for everyone. In partnership with 2 Bros Printing, we have also been able to do things like create custom logo masks for businesses.”And, after many years, Karen Burns’ sewing talent comes into play once again: “One of the mask styles is even hand stitched by my mother, Karen Burns.” he shares.     One negative impact the Covid19 pandemic did have on Dbgear as a business was removing fitness expos and competitions, which are usually a great way for them to gain visibility. Still, they remain strong in online sales on Etsy and Ebay. “Also, we participate in virtual fitness expos. Through our website, you can buy our products and also contact us for wholesale accounts for gyms and nutrition shops.”\nAttributes for success  I am personally not a weight trainer, but Dylan’s trajectory fascinates me. It reminds me that not settling when we face discomfort can lead to achievement and success. It also sheds light into the advantages of being open to listening to others’ ideas and to the strength of partnerships. I wish Dbgear maximum life and durability, like the quality lifting belts they started with.

Rebecca Delaney is a fun, upbeat, and quirky licensed esthetician. She is currently the proud owner and partner of her own small business- Bex Skincare \u0026 Acne Management LLC. She provides many skincare services for people of all ages and genders, and has for two years now. At 38, she has been married to her supportive husband Jude for 5 years, as of August 2020. He patiently lets her practice skincare at home on both him and herself. The couple have many pets- three adorable cats (Clyde, Poe, and Lolo) and a dog, all of which she enjoys spending her free time with if she isn’t busy with work.   How Rebecca Became Passionate About Skincare:  As a teenager in the 90s, Rebecca Delaney had acne and was unsure how to fix it. She depended heavily on gossip and word of mouth, which wasn’t always reliable. In the end, she got into skincare not only because she had struggled with her own skin, but because she was curious about biology and why or how certain techniques and ingredients work.  WhenDr. Sandra Lee, better known as Dr. Pimple Popper, became popular on YouTube several years ago, Rebecca learned that she wasn’t the only person who enjoyed popping blackheads. I mean, let’s be honest- who doesn’t love popping pimples from time to time? This act is a very important part of cleansing skin, and the satisfaction of watching the videos made her want to learn how to do it professionally. Overall, it’s safe to say that Rebecca Delaney has a true thirst for knowledge in her career field.  “I just had my first facial ever, and cannot emphasize enough the difference it made on my skin. Rebecca's wisdom and gentle hands removed lots of stubborn milia (that had been there for over a year). The experience rejuvenated my skin and soul in a way that feels life changing. No exaggeration . Others have noticed and remarked on the difference. I'll be Following her knowledge and skin care education to the tee. Do yourself a favor and see her, you'll be thanking yourself.” -Alexandra Franjola 9/2019  Rebecca’s Client Base is Surprisingly Diverse:  Not only does Rebecca love the science and technicalities behind her job, but she enjoys the social aspect of being an esthetician. As one of her regular clients, I can attest that she is always fun to chat with. While she understands that some people want a quiet and relaxing facial, she also knows that the silence can sometimes make a client feel uneasy. Many of her regulars love that she is personable, friendly, and easy to open up to. She not only keeps you entertained with great conversation, but Delaney also explains everything she does and why. This helps to instill a level of confidence in her clients that they may not get elsewhere- they aren’t having to take a leap of faith on their skincare.  Her clients have ranged in age from 10 to 85, which means she gets to engage with all sorts of people, both men and women. Primarily she sees people from their late teens to early 20s, such as myself, but she still sees a good amount of people who are dealing with adult onset acne. Skin can do surprising things at any age, and everyone deserves to look and feel their best! Rebecca loves getting older, as she sees age as the gift of wisdom and experience. The older she gets the more she learns about her profession! The longer she has this job, the more she discovers about how to connect with her client base.  “I took my 15 year old daughter for skin care treatment (It REALLY helped, we're planning on monthly trips even though it's a long drive for us!). I'm not easily impressed, but the owner has made a safe, comfortable environment, is clearly very well-educated in her work, shows real caring, and is very personable. She was so much fun to talk to, I was sad when it was over and it was time to go! I HIGHLY recommend her services” - Ginger-Kathleen Coombs 03/2018 Delaney Offers Many Different Services:  While shed specializes in acne management, Rebecca Delaney offers many services at Bex Skincare \u0026 Acne Management LLC.   “We dropped a couple of things and added some new services because my process has evolved on it’s own,” she explains, with the following as her most recent list of services:  Classic Facial Acne Treatment Facial Hydration Facial Extraction Facial Dermaplaning Lip Wax Eyebrow Wax Mini Facial Leg Wax  Her Favorite Services to Perform:  Her services are all well loved and always have you leaving with both a glowing smile and glowing skin. While all of her clients have their favorite services, so does Rebecca. Acne treatment is her favorite thing to do, no matter what service. “It is the most challenging thing, particularly because it can be emotional for someone struggling. Oftentimes I find if we chat about potential factors, it’s less confusing and frustrating,” she explained to me. This is why the majority of her services revolve around acne treatment and skincare.  Getting blemishes out and on their way is a major source of joy for her, as well as something that provides a sense of accomplishment and pride. She knows all too well how it feels to have a giant, difficult and painful pimple, so when she is able to help someone move toward clarity, it feels wonderful for her.    Facial massage is another favorite of her services to perform- and one of mine to have done. She feels that performing facial massage is almost as relaxing as it is to be receiving one. It’s an important step of the facial where hydration can be infused by simply using your two hands and special movements. As she often tells people, it’s “like giving your skin a trip to the gym!” That said, her facial massages come with all of her facials and are well worth the time and money. Rebecca’s Supportive Community:  Delaney is a part of a wonderful community because of her small business. Rebecca is originally from Massachusetts, born and raised, but Bex Skincare \u0026 Acne Management LLC. is currently located inside of Sola Salons, in Beaverton, Oregon, where the other business owners have formed their own type of micro-community. They all do their part to share and network, so they can help each other as much as possible. There is a wide variety of businesses in the salon, so they will often have the opportunity to hype up one another’s skill sets. This is very useful to Rebecca, as most of her referrals are from clients or her Sola community.  The rest of her publicity is done online, like onFacebook. Outside Sola, Rebecca often donate treatments to charity auctions for schools and nonprofits when people request. She doesn’t have children of her own, but she wants to do her part to help fund local schools’ music programs and give back to her home. How COVID-19 Has Affected the Skincare Field:  COVID-19, however, has had a huge impact on her business. COVID has affected her career on every level, really. She’s had to change all of her health protocol, the way she books her clients, her prices, her sanitation, etc. She learned in cosmetology school how important the physical touch can be, using skin to skin contact, but during these times, gloves and masks are key. Using gloves throughout the entire session is an adjustment that both Rebecca and her clients have had to adapt to.  Contact tracing has also become a critical and mandatory part of salon life, and it’s felt different since reopening. I suppose we are all figuring out our way through the dark! Clients entering the building also have to wear a mask when they are not in their session (or for the whole thing, if their face isn’t being touched) and do not get to touch the doors either. Everyone must wait outside and have someone else push a button to let them in.  Before COVID she had just passed her two year business anniversary and was exponentially growing her clientele. She doubled the amount of clientele every year! Hopefully, after the COVID virus gets under control, that trend will continue and she will be able to reach all of her business related goals. Delaney’s Best Skincare Advice:  If you are going to take anything away from this article, let it be that Rebecca Delaney wants people to feel safe when they go to see her- not judged. She doesn’t harass people for bad skin habits because we are all human. Nobody is perfect when it comes to their skin and how they treat it, even your licensed esthetician. Her job is to help people understand what’s best for their skin so they can take that knowledge and apply it as they’re ready, which is why she goes through great lengths to explain what it is she is doing for their skin and how they can continue the care at home.  She wants people to be educated on their products, such asbenzoyl peroxide. Many people use too much of it, and there are many gentler products that do the same job just as well. She also says people tend to rely on foaming cleansers a lot when a gel, cream or oil is better. People tend to be much harsher on their skin then necessary.  Sunscreen is another big topic with Rebecca, as she always stresses its importance. You don’t only need it when in the sun; sunscreen should be applied every day. SPF 35 is plenty for most people.  Her best advice is to always cleanse, tone, then hydrate! That’s the basics. It’s simple! She loves to help people learn why cleansing for a few minutes daily is the main key to clearer, brighter skin.  “Rebecca is the absolute best esthetician I have ever met! She is sweet as punch, SO smart, witty \u0026 has the most graceful way of sharing her vast knowledge base with you over the course of your facial in an accessible way. She is also not afraid of extractions \u0026 is gentle, yet effective. Her massage techniques, hot towels \u0026 tapping increase circulation leaving your face soft \u0026 healthy when you leave- can not recommend her enough!” -Chloe Radically 6/2019  As you can tell, Rebecca Delaney is very passionate about her small business, Bex Skincare \u0026 Acne Management LLC. She genuinely enjoys the process of each of her services, as well as engaging with the clientele and her community. No matter where she is or what she is doing, Rebecca always has a cheery and positive attitude that is bound to help you feel great about who you have hired. No matter what your skincare needs are, Delaney comes highly recommended and is worth meeting at least once.

Jay lives in Newberg with his wife, Lisa, and their two children and the family dog.    Jay grew up in Sonoma County and received his degree in Enology from Fresno State University. In the first part of his career, he spent time working at wineries in both Sonoma and Napa Valley. He then decided to make a move to the Willamette Valley in 2000 to join the Oregon Pinot Noir renaissance and soon after started his own label. About Zimri Cellars  Jay is an old school winemaker. He’s involved in every aspect of the winemaking process, from sourcing local fruit to production and sales. His intention is to keep it small and personable therefore he only makes around 400 cases of fine wine per year.     His customers include restaurants, liquor stores, events, and festival organizations as well as direct sales. He really enjoys making a personal connection with each of his visits. So when you order wine from Jay, he and Lisa will be the ones who personally deliver it to you.  Zimri Cellars’ wines are balanced and approachable. Each bottle expresses the region from where the fruit was sourced. Not only are they high quality but affordable as well. How is he able to sell his wine for such a great price, you ask? Zimri Cellars does not have the overhead of a vineyard, sales team, or other employees, therefore keeping costs at a minimum. Let's Ask Jason Some Questions We're from the business world, so we were curious about how things are done in Jay's winemaking world.\nEmily: Walk me through a day in the life of the owner of Zimri Cellars. What are your daily tasks? Jay: As the owner of a small business, no day is exactly the same. One day you may find me working in the cellar tending to the wine and the next day I could be out and about making new connections with potential customers. There are generally three busy times a year for a winemaker: The first is the growing season where I visit the vineyards to monitor the growth of the grapes. The second and most important is harvest time, where you only get one shot at making it right. The third, and hardest part of the business is selling the wine. The upside to sales is that we often find ourselves enjoying engaging conversation with customers, and often great food as well with the many owners and staff of the restaurants we service.\n  Emily:  You told us about the three busy times of the year for a wine maker. Once you get to the actual winemaking process, what happens then?\nJay: There are 5 steps to winemaking\n Harvest: Our fruit is sourced from a number of small local growers. These relationships with our growers are important, and communication throughout the growing season is critical to growing the best fruit possible - from flowering to testing final sugars. That’s why I visit the vineyards during the growing season and again at harvest time. Once picking is complete the grapes are delivered to the winery for processing. Crushing and Pressing: The fruit is gently processed as it is moved through the different phases in the winery. First comes the sorting and removal of stems, followed by a press, where the juice is extracted. The juice then receives yeast and is inoculated, undergoing a carefully monitored fermentation. Fermentation: With our white wines we ferment slow and cold to retain flavors and esters. As for red wine, we like to control the warmth of the fermentation in order to get nice flavor and color extraction. Aging: All of our red wines age for a minimum of 18 months in French Oak barrels. The percentage of new oak varies from wine to wine depending on what is desired as an outcome. Our white wines typically don’t age for long. Most see just stainless steel barrels unless it is our Chardonnay which is fermented and aged in Oak. Fining and bottling: We tend not to fine or filter our red wines. The 18 months of aging will usually clarify our red wine nicely. Our white wines do however go through a fining process where the wine is clarified for the consumer before bottling.    Emily: All that work happens then a year and a half before you actually sell any of the wine you are producing, right? So how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted your business so far?\nJay: Well as we all know, quite a bit has changed due to the pandemic. Most of our sales are to local restaurants. With the shift and the way restaurants and wine bars are now operating our sales have dropped considerably. However, we continue to make contactless home deliveries to our friends and followers.\n Because Lisa and I are the ones delivering the wine, we can assure that the orders will be carefully packed following all CDC COVID-19 safety guidelines and deliver your order to your door. This keeps both our family and yours safe and healthy.  Because of the pandemic, we, unfortunately, haven’t been able to attend the many great festivals and local events in the area, which we enjoy so much. We hope that as things begin to reopen we will once again be there to serve wine and enjoy the connections.  Despite all of the things that have changed during these tough times, the one thing that remains the same is our dedication to providing wine lovers with the best wine possible. Emily: Do you have a favorite wine or one you’re particularly proud of?\n Jay: Our2013 Pinot Noir is pretty special. We only produced 111 cases. We aged this wine in a combination of new and used French oak barrels for 22 months. The berry aromas and oak seasoning, combined with soft tannins and red berry flavors all come together to create a graceful wine.    For more information about Zimri Cellars wines, contact Jay directly through his website.

Apply for Jobs on Upwork  Now that you’ve set up your profile on Upwork, it’s time to start applying for gigs. Last year 3 million freelancersmade a salary of $100k or more. Let’s help you get a piece of that action. Use Connects for Upwork Jobs You Want the Most  Connects are the currency in which freelancers can apply to jobs on Upwork. Think of connects as virtual tokens or coins. Each month, Upwork automatically loads connects to your account. They can transfer from month-to-month if unused, but they do expire after one year. If you run out of connects, you can purchase additional connects for 15 cents at any time (minimum 10 required).  Larger jobs require more connects. But if you’re messaged by an Upwork Talent Specialist to apply for a job, you do not need to use any of your connects to apply. Also, if you apply for a job that is later canceled or closed without hiring a freelancer, your connects are refunded to your account. Search for a Gig on Upwork  Upwork offers a number of ways for freelancers to find gigs and connect talented freelancers to businesses in need of their services. You can search via the search bar or scroll through your feed based on what Upwork’s algorithm determines jobs for which you may be interested in applying. My personal favorite way to search for a gig on Upwork is to utilize the saved search feature in the newsfeed. I can use filters to determine a type of role, such as blog writing and expert level. Then, when I’m searching for a new gig or have a craving to write a blog post for a new customer, I can check the saved search feed at any time. Finding Freelance Gigs with Upwork: Final Thoughts   Setting up your profile to target the work you must want to do is a great way to find your ideal customers. Use specialized profiles to offer multiple services at different prices.   Carefully use your connects to apply for jobs you really want to apply for based on your searches and job feed.   Save searches for your favorite types of gigs. When you have space in your week or have a hankering for the particular type of work, you can easily pull up a feed of hundreds of gigs ready for you to apply.

Or do you consider yourself a solopreneur or gig worker?  Whether you’re writing blog posts late at night and on the weekends like I am, or you run your construction business out of your truck, your day is jam-packed with everything from your actual work to balancing your ledger and handling customer service.  And as more businesses shift toward remote and workers look for more flexible work arrangements, the need to be as efficient as possible has never been higher. The 21st Century and the Seismic Shift to Remote Working  Leading up to 2020, the gig economy was booming forward with more and more organizations embracing freelancers to complete work in various departments. Today 4 in 5 workers consider a flexible work arrangement the most important factor when determining a job offer or staying at their current company.  And then the COVID-19 global pandemic hit the western hemisphere in March 2020, leading to stay-at-home orders and companies shifting to remote working for most corporate and non-essential positions. These two forces combine to form the future of work, where companies see the cost-savings opportunities and employees enjoy the flexibility to work from home. At the end of March,3 in 4 CFOssurveyed by Gartner indicated they were planning to shift employees’ roles to fully remote jobs. Types of Freelance Jobs in the US  There are many types of freelance roles and places to find them online -- includingUpworkandFiverr, both job sites specifically for freelancers. Popular Freelance Jobs in the US  Copywriting or other marketing roles Teaching or tutoring Legal services Web development and coding Administrative support   Source:https://moneyconnexion.com/freelance-jobs-on-top-10-best-freelance-websites.htm One common thread between these types of jobs include the ability to work remotely using online tools and cloud software. Additionally, some of these jobs can be done outside of business hours. Tools for Freelancers Productivity  With freelancing or working from home full-time, it’s easy to get distracted by overflowing email inboxes, social media, and the constant notifications on our smartphones. A few tips to help with this include setting a schedule and creating a dedicated workspace to ensure you’re focused on work. (No, your bed isn’t your office.)  Another way to become more productive is to use a simple project management tool to help keep track of your time, projects, and set deadlines for yourself or others on your team. Trello is a simple project management tool that offers afree version that allows freelancers or small businesses to manage projects on a corkboard with cards and checklists. You can also integrate the tool with cloud-based programs like Google Drive or Dropbox. Business operations  Although ‘free’ is the prefix of the word freelancer, there are quite a few rules and regulations that freelancers should follow when conducting business for tax and legal purposes.  Skyclerk is an app that provides business owners and freelancersa simple bookkeeping ledgerfor balancing revenue and expenses on-the-go. This is especially useful for freelancers or jobs outside of the office or with frequent travel.  Stripe is an online tool and app forcollecting online payments and managing customer invoices and billing information. You can schedule reminders to encourage clients to complete outstanding payments for services, track revenue with built-in reporting, and even set up automatic recurring payments. Job-specific tools  There are a number of helpful online tools for freelancers based on job type:   Legal   Casemaker (legal research)   Google Scholar (legal research)     Transcription  oTranscribe (transcribe interviews for journalists) Express Scribe (transcribe audio files)    Teaching or tutoring  Click Meeting (webinar software) Vedamo (e-Learning platform)    Copywriting   Grammarly(grammar checker; Google Chrome extension available)   Hubspot Blog Topic Generator (blog writing ideas)     Is the Freelance Life Right for You?  It’s true. There are several reasons to have a side hustle: Supplement or diversify your income, expand your skill set, and unleash creativity. But whatever you’re reasoning, you should be prepared to cover the additional work needed to manage your side hustle like its own business.  When it comes to determining whether freelancing is right for you, test it out first with a side gig or two to balance your work and get comfortable. Life of a Freelancer: Final Thoughts   Freelance jobs include consulting, contract employees, side hustles, and flexible gigs and can be full or part-time. As freelancing becomes more common, nearly half of all US workers will perform some form of gig work in the next decade.   In the same way there are many ways to find gig work today, there are also many ways to arrange your tech stack for running your freelance business. There are software programs and online tools that are free to start.   Be prepared to do the work of a business owner to manage your side hustle, including taxes and accounting, customer service, as well as your own work.

Recently, however, as I added a second floor onto my house, I got a 2020 update into the construction industry. Here I discuss one specific aspect that stood out to me: how construction contractors are pricing their work. Like a responsible homeowner, I got 3-5 estimates for just about every building trade involved in the project. Throughout this process, I discovered how unbelievably diverse contractor pricing can be. Many will argue that builder pricing is a gauge of quality. I reject that notion when analysing my recent experience because, although some contractors differ in the quality of their work, they are not even invited to bid on my projects unless they meet my minimum standard. When comparing construction bids, quality was a constant among the candidates, thus it was not a concern. Types of Construction Contractors Based on my 2020 observations, there are 4 main types of contractors in the market. The type of estimate you get should differ based on the type of company they are.\n  One Dude and a truck: This is your solo entrepreneur. Just one person, a truck full of tools, and a can-do attitude. This contractor is often hard to get a hold of, takes a while to give you a formal bid, and can be booked out weeks. The main reason: he is busy doing the work. When you are framing a deck you can’t be taking phone calls, typing up proposals, or heading out to bid a job.   Two Dudes and a truck: Very similar to the solo entrepreneur, but often 2 friends working together under the same company. No real employees. This type of business tends to solve some of the issues a one-man construction company has. They can, for example, divide and conquer. While one partner works on the current project, the other bids the next project. I find this to be a good hybrid of customer service and dedication to the actual work.   One Dude with employees: With this structure, you typically have the owner and a team of employees. The owner is often out giving estimates, and meeting with customers while the employees do the work. In this scenario, the owner usually works from his home office rather than a commercial office. Customers feel well taken care of because the owner is the liaison for the project.   Big company construction: This corporate structure likely started out as one of the above-mentioned contractors, but grew over time. This company has a big well-known office, project managers, salespeople, dedicated employees to do the work, bookkeepers, and an infinity of other capacities. These types of businesses often have been around for years, and plan to be around for many more years to come.   Maybe you figured out where I was heading with this — each one of these types of contractors has their own unique business overhead to account for when setting their pricing. The dude and a truck maintains very little overhead compared to the big company construction contractors. Pricing Based On Company Type Now the question is: for the same work, and same quality, should all 4 of these businesses have the same pricing? I submit….no.\nI reckon this is why I get such a wide range in pricing when trying to bid out my personal projects. Each contractor thinks about this differently. And they should. Because, as outlined above, their product - not only the final outcome on the project, but all they offer as contractors - can vary wildly.\nIt is very common for an employee to leave a big company after learning that an hour of work was being charged $100, thinking he can make the same $100 an hour on his own as a dude and a truck. It is very common for an employee to leave a big company after learning that an hour of work was being charged $100, thinking he can make the same $100 an hour on his own as a dude and a truck. In his mind he is delivering the same service the big company is offering, so why should he not collect the full wage? Very simply put, he is missing the additional infrastructure the big company is offering. The big company offers a dedicated project manager who will resolve any issues in near real-time, and make sure the project goes off without a hitch. This person removes any possible frustration a customer could have throughout the project. The big company also has a reputation and assets. When you have a reputation and public assets you do right by your customers. You build things right, you warranty things when they go wrong. You have something to lose, the customer has something to come after if you don’t hold up your end satisfactory. If a dude and a truck moves out of the area or stops answering your phone calls, it is really hard to track them down and force them to resolve any outstanding issues. When a customer hires a big company, they are getting the peace of mind that, in case anything goes wrong, now or into, the future they are likely covered. And they are paying for that peace of mind.\nSo no, a solo entrepreneur should not be priced anywhere near what a big company is pricing projects at. Those who understand this differentiator tend to win more jobs with customers because their pricing is typically 30% - 60% of what a big company charges. With a solo entrepreneur, customers should be getting much better pricing. They are, however, taking on a bigger risk with a less established construction contractor. Pricing should be a scale based on how you organize your business. So of course pricing should change accordingly for the other 2 types of contractors I mentioned above. Lessons to be Learned Here If you are a homeowner hiring a new contractor, ask questions and try to truly understand how they are organizing their business. Use that knowledge to evaluate the pricing they are giving you, considering the overhead that led to it. Ignoring that relationship can give you a false sense of what you are getting. If you are a construction contractor, remember these factors when setting your pricing. Are you confused about why you are not landing projects when your pricing is the same as the big guys? Or maybe you are discounting your price by 10% compared to the big companies. Likely 10% is not enough to make up for your lack of establishment and structure. You may think you are giving a customer a deal, but they would rather just pay a bit more for the comfort of having a big company behind the work. Markets are efficient. There’s probably no such thing as a good deal or bad deal when hiring a service provider. Pricing simply matches what is being offered.

In three short years, gig workers are expected to rake in\u0026nbsp;over $450 billion. And as companies reel with the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, more and more people will join the gig economy to build additional streams of income or create a new career for themselves.\nWhy Should I File My Freelance Income Separate from Personal Income? Picture this: You\u0026rsquo;re a graphic designer that works for an organization in Boston, and you make $45,000 per year plus benefits. You like the stability of a 9 to 5, but you\u0026rsquo;re also looking to be more creative in your spare time. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to earn a few extra bucks moonlighting, right?\nAfter a few days\u0026rsquo; work of setting up an online portfolio and profiles on a few freelance sites, you start designing logos and brochures for a handful of clients that pay you through various channels: Fiverr, Upwork, PayPal, and more. That income is all deposited into your personal bank account, and you use it to supplement your income. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ll go out for a nice dinner more often. Or, maybe you use the extra funds to finally upgrade your kitchen.\nThen tax season comes. And it hits you: Instead of getting a 3 or 4-figure tax refund, you owe 4 or 5-figures. How are you going to pay your tax bill? This story is a story of someone with a very expensive hobby not a business, my friend. And with just a few side projects, you\u0026rsquo;ve put yourself in a personal income pickle for the next 1-2 years paying back taxes to the IRS in monthly payments or putting the tax bill on your credit card. (And those IRS payments are all being made with post-tax dollars of your personal income!)\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a better way to do this. First, you need to file your freelance income as a business. Separating your freelance income from your personal income is the best way to ensure you\u0026rsquo;ve protected your personal assets and can realize a sustainable profit for your freelance business. To get started, you just need to figure out which business type makes the most sense for you.\nWhat Is the Difference Between an LLC and S Corporation? Let\u0026rsquo;s start by defining these two common business entity types:\nA limited liability company (LLC)\u0026nbsp;protects\u0026nbsp;the individual owners and their personal assets from any losses, debts, or liabilities incurred by the company. An LLC also helps protect the owners from double taxation, since all business income is filed through their personal income taxes.\nAn S Corporation (S-Corp) balances the double-taxation protection\u0026nbsp;of a limited partnership with passing on business income profits and losses to shareholders. The IRS has stricter guidelines for this type of business entity for both incorporation and operation of the business.\nHow you register your business impacts not only your tax filings each year, but it will also play a large role in how you operate your business day-to-day. From how you invoice and receive payments from customers\u0026nbsp;to how you pay for business services and employees, choosing the right business type has many factors to consider.\nExercise: Make a Pros and Cons List When it comes to choosing the best type of business for your own work, it can be difficult to decide what\u0026rsquo;s best for you. Freelancing may not feel like a business to you yet, but it should. Of course, once you separate your freelance income from your personal income, it\u0026rsquo;ll start to feel like a business and the rest will fall into place. This step is crucial. So, we\u0026rsquo;ve done some of the work for you by weighing key features of an LLC vs. an S-Corp to help you decide:\n   \u0026nbsp; LLC S Corp.     Separate from owners\u0026rsquo; personal income X X   Annual tax filing required X X   Self-employment tax required X \u0026nbsp;   Documentation and process requirements for shareholders, stock, company operations \u0026nbsp; X   Best with Passive Investors \u0026nbsp; X   Restrictions on eligibility \u0026nbsp; X   Protection from double taxation X X       Once you\u0026rsquo;ve decided and registered your business with your state, you will need to track your income and expenses\u0026nbsp;accordingly. Filing Freelance Income as a Business: Final Thoughts  As more freelance work is available and the traditional 9 to 5 begins to shift, gig workers need to protect their freelance income and run their side hustles as businesses. Determining what type of business entity to form involved many factors, including how you pay employees, accept payment from customers, and file both your personal and business taxes each year. An LLC or S Corporation are common business types for small businesses and freelancers. With a few things in common, each business type has various pros and cons to weigh when considering which entity is right for your business. Whether you design graphics from a home office or install hardwood floors for a family friend, tracking your freelance income and expenses like a business will help you maximize your profits and protect your personal assets.

If you have already applied, please sit back and enjoy the rest of this post. If you are like me, a form of depression is coming on fast. The year 2020 started off so promising and now it has gone to hell with no clear end in sight. Sales are down, making payroll is a real worry, and all your exciting business goals for 2020 are postponed indefinitely. Furthermore, that rainy day savings account has dropped considerably due to the stock market tanking.  What should we as business owners do during this time to stay upbeat and not sacrifice this time with depressive thoughts? Here are some suggestions from our customers, and personal changes I have made to help weather this storm.\n Change Your Routine. We are all stuck at home. We are all worried. It is very easy to get brought down by the thought of “same shit different day”. This is not an uplifting mindset. I have made an effort to change up my routine nearly every day. I start my mornings differently, I read different things, I work on different tasks in unorthodox ways and end my days differently. I have found keeping things new and different has fought off the depressive thoughts that kept me from charging forward. Use This Time to Zoom Out. Our economy has been in a massive bull market since March of 2009. Most of us have been chasing one great opportunity after another -- #Winning every day! When times are good we often forget to zoom out. In the last few weeks, I have reviewed all my long term goals with Skyclerk and have realized many of these goals were not well thought out or did not have optimal ROIs. I think this zoomed out review process will pay bigger dividends in the long run. There is something exhilarating about a renewed focus. Go on Vacation. Well, not really. We are not allowed to leave our houses, but take a break from life. One restaurant owner I know has taken this opportunity to have downtime. He explained to me he has not had a vacation since 2012 -- before he opened his restaurant. He told me he is reading more, catching up on TV, and doing house projects he never thought he would do. He is totally putting aside his business - for now. He hopes this time will supercharge his business efforts when he is allowed to open back up again. Work on the Bottom of your Todo List. A contractor customer of ours explained to me that with his newfound downtime he is working on stuff he has never had the time to get to. He used the example of opening an Instagram account. Some of us might laugh and think how hard it is but when you are a contractor out in the field all day, finding computer time, and the time to upload content can be challenging. His hope is when we emerge from this Covid-19 mess he will be better positioned to win contracts. He sees this time as an opportunity to focus on things he has struggled to do for years. Take Care of Your Customers and Employees. A lot of us have been so focused on growth since the last downturn we have forgotten to take extra good care of our customers and team members. Growth is on hold for the moment. Let’s focus on what we have. Reach out to your customers and thank them, see if there is anything you can do for them during this time. Spend extra time with your team to learn what their needs and wants are. Maybe this is a time to support an employee to learn something new, or work on something outside of their day-to-day activities. I think many of us will be judged by how we treated our customers and employees during this time. Those of us who did right by them will likely have a leg up in the future. Wait, what does this suggestion have to do with the fighting of depression? Simply put, it moves your focus to something positive and hopefully motivating.  The Internet is crowded with these types of posts -- “How people should survive the Covid-19 recession”. I am fully aware everything I suggested is not some new mind-blowing concept. My primary goal was to be one more voice saying you are not alone. Business owners everywhere are struggling, not just financially but emotionally. Freelancers and small business owners are worried, but as they say, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.\n","permalink":"https://skyclerk.com/blog/dealing-with-covid-19-small-business-or-freelancer-depression/","tags":null,"title":"Dealing with Covid-19 - Small Business or Freelancer Depression"},{"categories":["Company News"],"contents":" In June of this year, we announced that Skyclerk was changing -- changing for the better. We were saying goodbye to the Cloudmanic Labs umbrella and taking on the world as just Skyclerk. Today, I would like to announce Skycerk 3.0 is here and better than ever!  As part of this transition, we did a complete rewrite of Skyclerk -- meaning every line of code has been rewritten. Even though everything has changed under the hood, the Skyclerk that you know and love remains mostly the same (with a few upgrades). Skyclerk is crazy fast now! The biggest and most notable change is that Skyclerk is crazy fast now. Without a doubt, we are the fastest bookkeeping software on the market. Accounting is never fun, and waiting for your software to “think” just adds frustration. It is our mission to never waste a second of your time with slow software. Just Give Me the Highlights  Yes, we know product update announcements can be boring and self-aggrandizing so here is what you need to know.  Skyclerk is 100% free until February 2020. After that, it will be $6.00 a month. Current customers will be prompted to enter in their credit card numbers again. If you had set your currency to something other than US dollars you will have to update your currency again. Here is a support document showing you how to fix it. We moved the Contacts section of Skyclerk to the Settings area. It makes room for future improvements. The Skyclerk 3.0 is designed for iteration. If you have any suggestions or feedback please let us know by emailing us at help@skyclerk.com.  I want to know more… what are the deets? Once you log into Skyclerk 3.0, you will notice some subtle changes. Along with a revamped new dashboard, we moved the Contacts, Categories, and Labels into Settings. These user interface changes give us many more options for future growth -- Invoicing is coming soon.\nAnother big change is that Skyclerk will to longer offer a free version. We explained this move in more detail in our Cheapest Bookkeeping Software on the Market blog post. Simply put, we felt that our efforts to support non-paying customers were taking away from our paying customers -- How is this fair? To make up for this change we reduced the cost of Skyclerk to $6.00 a month or $60.00 per year.\nSkyclerk is free to everyone until February 1st, 2020. To give our customers time to adjust to the new pricing, Skyclerk is free to everyone until February 1st, 2020. At this point, all customers will have to reenter their credit card number. We updated our payments system as part of Skyclerk 3.0, which means we also deleted all past customer credit card numbers. Lastly, the changes caused the currency settings for our international customers to be blown away, and all Skyclerk accounts to be back to being US dollar-based. However, we made sure to offer a very easy process to change this back by following the directions outlined here. Our Roadmap Going Forward The number one reason for all this change is that after 9 years Skyclerk had become stale. We found innovation to Skyclerk to be cumbersome and slow. With Skyclerk 3.0, we are looking forward to the new and exciting future that Skyclerk can have. For 2020, we are planning to integrate auto bank importing into Skyclerk, and finally launch an invoicing feature. Along with these two innovations, we plan to continue to improve our existing offering. Keep an eye on your inbox and our blog to follow along with our new path forward.\nSkyclerk has been around for over 9 years! Skyclerk has been around and profitable for over 9 years. Customers from our very early days are still using Skyclerk every day. We could not be more thankful for the continued loyalty to Skyclerk. We hope Skyclerk 3.0 excites you all as much as it does us.

At my daughter’s school, there are limited parking spots in close proximity to the front door while the rest of the parking spots require lugging my daughter across a sometimes busy parking lot. Morning dropoff is stressful, to say the least, we are always late, my kids never cooperate, and there are always multiple belongings that need to make it into the classroom or a four-year-old meltdown is inevitable. As I am tracking across the parking lot there is one thing I always notice -- the owner of the school has parked her car in a prime front row parking spot. Even on 30 below zero days with 3 feet of fresh snow on the ground, he would not waver and park any closer to the front door.  My father was an insurance agent with his office in a big 3 story office mall. The parking lot for this building must have had room for 500 cars and almost never completely filled up but my father made a point to always park as far away from the front door as possible. Even on 30 below zero days with 3 feet of fresh snow on the ground, he would not waver and park any closer to the front door. At a young age, I asked him why he parked so far away and he told me the experience his customers have while visiting him was very important to him and it started when they pulled into the parking lot. In his view, they should have front row parking.  Obsessing with Customer’s Experience is a Win Want to take your small business and turn it into a big business? Then obsess over experience. This is not a new concept, Jeff Bezos has been preaching this for years through his customer-focused culture at Amazon, but this is something most business owners tend to neglect or are not detail-oriented enough for. In another example, there is a plaza near where I work that has a number of eating options but my preferred is a sandwich place at the far end of the building. When I pull in I often look for parking in front, if there is not I might need to go to the opposite end of the plaza to find parking. While walking to the sandwich shop I pass by 3 other places to eat. I almost never make it to the sandwich shop. I always convince myself to try something different before getting to the front door of my go-to lunch spot. Something I recently observed is the owner stops by most days during lunchtime to support his team during rush hour. Guess where he parks? Right in front. His choice to park upfront cost him the $15 I was about to spend that day. Had I gotten his parking spot I would not have been tempted by other offerings.  My guess is both the sandwich shop owner and the daycare owner were far too consumed with countless other concerns a small business often has to even notice the negative impact they had on their customers and revenue. As a small business entrepreneur, it is nearly impossible to prioritize everything but one simple thing has always made my life better as a business owner: more revenue. I have found if I focus on delighting my customers, revenue will follow, and the rest of my day to day worries will be far easier to manage. Customer Experience is All About the Little Things The examples above are small. I am sure no business will succeed or fail based on where the owner parks. Still, these subtle things can add up and subconsciously turn customers off. I tend to notice these things, thanks to my father. Other customers, however, may not, and they could be turned off without even realizing it. A different person might stop eating at the sandwich shop without ever defining why they are discouraged. I think many business owners do not consider the subconscious effects on how they manage their business. One of the earliest interactions with a customer is to signal a lack of trust. The bartender is suggesting the customer will leave without paying. Have you ever walked into a bar and the bartender asks for and holds your credit card while opening a tab? This is a very negative and I submit it is often poor business practice. In this example, one of the earliest interactions with a customer is to signal a lack of trust. The bartender is suggesting the customer will leave without paying. It would be one thing if the bar was making the customer’s life easier so when they were done they could simply walk out effortlessly paying the bill but that is not the typical case. I understand some bars have issues with people “dining and dashing”, so a bar owner has to weigh the pros and cons - but few realize there are cons that should be deeply considered.  For my last example, have you ever noticed some subscription businesses make it very hard to discontinue the service? Canceling the service might lead to a great deal of time on the phone going from department to department. Some entrepreneurs think this is a strategy to save the customer. In reality, it is a great way to ensure a customer never comes back and likely does not recommend the company to others. This approach is trading short term greed for long term growth. A leader obsessed with customer experience would make sure canceling their service is painless as it will likely lead to revenue in other ways -- counterintuitive right? As a rule of thumb business owners should be primarily focused on delighting their customers in any way possible. The customer experience is often the key to sustained long term growth. Every subtle interaction should be closely optimized for customer enchantment, and a decision as simple as where to park your car can subconsciously attract or detract a customer.\n","permalink":"https://skyclerk.com/blog/if-you-run-a-small-business-park-in-the-back-of-the-parking-lot/","tags":null,"title":"If you Run a Small Business Park In the Back of the Parking Lot"},{"categories":["Company News"],"contents":" Today, I am very pleased to announce we are cutting the price of Skyclerk by 60% making it the cheapest bookkeeping software on the market. No other cloud-based, ad-free software comes close to us in price. We are now offering Skyclerk for $6 a month or $60 when you pay for an entire year at once. Current customers will be billed this new price starting today.  Saying Good-Bye to our Free Account Yes, everything has a catch in this world -- to make our new pricing possible, we have decided to sunset our free account offering. Starting today, Skyclerk is no longer offering a free account. Every new customer will have 15 days to try out Skyclerk risk-free (no credit card required). Current customers using Skyclerk’s free accounts will have until October 1st, 2019 to upgrade.\nWe feel our new pricing is so low that not grandfathering in our free customers is acceptable. With that said, if you are using Skyclerk in a particular way that only a free account makes sense please reach out to us at help@skyclerk.com. We promise to be fair and reasonable -- we will find a way to make things right. There is nothing worse than a software provider changing their terms after you have invested so much time in the platform. We get that, and we will try our best to make things right with legacy customers who have never had a need to upgrade. However, we will do this on a case-by-case basis.\nWe promise to be fair and reasonable -- we will find a way to make things right.  As a side note, we will continue to support our non-profit, and young bootstrapped startup customers with free accounts. Please just reach out to us.\nWhy the Price Changes? Are you all on Drugs?  When we launched Skyclerk nearly 9 years ago, we wanted to offer a free account. We thought it was important for customers to start recording income and expenses from day one before their business had any real revenue. So many entrepreneurs start keeping good accounting books way too late when starting a business. If Skyclerk was free to use, everyone would start keeping good books from day one, right? We still believe this, and, although it saddens us that we need to put this goal aside for a greater goal, we are quite excited about the possibilities this change will bring to Skyclerk\nAs it turns out, we get a fair number of new free customers every week. New customers often need help onboarding and getting to know Skyclerk. We really appreciate their eagerness to learn a new tool, and we love helping our new customers out, but we are a small company - which means we have limits. The extra workload of our free customers was distracting us from providing world-class support for our paying customers. We also found when customers pay, they tend to be a bit more committed to our software. Many times, we have spent hours helping a free customer get to know Skyclerk only to have them jump ship. Skyclerk is not for everyone.  We want to focus on those who love our product and we think the best way to do that is to charge all customers. We get it. Everyone hates accounting/bookkeeping. Why make the pain worse with expensive software too? With our new super low pricing, we hope to keep Skyclerk at a range that is nothing more than a rounding error for any size company. For the price of a cup of coffee, you can have Skyclerk every month. To make that happen, the crack marketing team here at Skyclerk wanted a price that would allow us to be cheesy and say, “for the price of a cup of coffee you can have Skyclerk every month”! They researched for months to find a solution. Finally, they determined all software should be priced based on “a cup of coffee” ... Nah, just joking… we don’t have a marketing team :). How can you Charge So Little for Skyclerk? As we enter our 9th year in business as one of the simplest - yet most robust - bookkeeping software on the market, we have become a bit nostalgic. Skyclerk was originally written by one computer nerd held up in his spare bedroom. We gained our first 1,000 customers without much outside help, and we have never accepted a penny of outside investment. We are very proud of how much we have been able to accomplish with such a lean team over the years.  About a year ago we were thinking about growing the Skyclerk team and, as a result, pricing would necessarily raise. This is a common pattern of most software providers. Prey on early customers to find product/market fit then increase prices in an attempt to scale and take over the world. Admittedly, we thought that way for a while, but it soon dawned on us: Why not go in the other direction? Why do we need to expand our team to take over the world when we have already proven we can do so much with so little? We think we can continue our growth and only get from our customers what we need to run the business and earn a healthy (but modest) profit. Hence our new pricing.\nWe hope everyone cheers our new prices and understands our decision to discontinue our free plan. As we mentioned in our last blog post it is a new day for Skyclerk, and our new pricing is just an early step in making sure our coming years are as successful and customer-focused as our past years.\n","permalink":"https://skyclerk.com/blog/cheapest-bookkeeping-software-on-the-market/","tags":null,"title":"Cheapest Bookkeeping Software on the Market"},{"categories":["Company News"],"contents":" This coming August, Skyclerk will turn 9 years old. Today, we have tens of thousands of users and have grown month over month since the day we launched, without any help from a venture capitalist or outside funding. As many of you may know, Skyclerk’s parent company is Cloudmanic Labs. Many years ago, we at Cloudmanic Labs got a little arrogant. We figured the Cloudmanic brand would resonate through the Internet. If you purchased one Cloudmanic product, you would want all our software. So instead of marketing Skyclerk as a company in its own right, we kept Skyclerk under the Cloudmanic Labs umbrella. This was a mistake. Starting today, we are taking our first steps to spin Skyclerk off into its own entity free from Cloudmanic’s branding and such. We got so wrapped up in building different products, (most of which gained no traction or success), we forgot to put our customer first.\n With the early success, we assumed we could build a suite of software products and everyone would love them, but we overlooked one very very important thing: you, the customer. We got so wrapped up in building different products, (most of which gained no traction or success), we forgot to put our customer first. Our branding was confusing, our customer support was not helpful, and we failed to improve Skyclerk to support the changing times. That all changes today!\nWhat is changing? Skyclerk is still a product of Cloudmanic Labs but for our end users, this means nothing. Cloudmanic is just a holding company – a way to organize our business for tax and employment purposes. For matters which are important to our customers, Skyclerk will operate like an independent company. Today, you can no longer find Skyclerk under the cloudmanic.com domain. If you want to learn about Skyclerk, you simply visit skyclerk.com. You no longer have to navigate all the other Cloudmanic products or be confused as to what options trading has to do with freelancer accounting.  For at least a month or two, you will still access your Skyclerk account via https://skyclerk.cloudmanic.com but soon, that will be changing as well. The Skyclerk app will be moving to a new skyclerk.com sub-domain. More on this in a few weeks. This is the biggest benefit to our customers. We now have a faster, more flexible codebase. Under the hood, there has been a fair amount of work to break the Skyclerk codebase away from the shared Cloudmanic Labs infrastructure. This is the biggest benefit to our customers. We now have a faster, more flexible codebase. We are going to be able to iterate much faster and no longer be slowed down by the needs of other Cloudmanic software products. Lastly, we are doing away with the distractions our teams have faced in the past. In the past, our team worked on all the different Cloudmanic software products. This made the team “a jack of all trades but a master of none”. As we spin Skyclerk out, we will have a dedicated team just for Skyclerk. No more distractions. We will be thinking about how to make bookkeeping and accounting better, faster, and less complex for freelancers every day from now on.\nMy thoughts as the founder of Skyclerk I could not be more excited about this change. I started building Skyclerk in 2004 to solve my own needs. In fact, I never had plans to release it to the world, but when I did, I realized how many solo entrepreneurs and freelancers needed accounting/bookkeeping software tailored to them. Bloatware products such as Quickbooks and Xero are overwhelming and unnecessary for smaller businesses.\nI could not be prouder or happier to share this news with you all. By simplifying and focusing the Skyclerk team, we are going to be able to continue to remove the annoyance of bookkeeping and accounting for our customers in new ways. To our current customers, thank you for supporting us over the years. We plan to wow you in new ways, going forward.\nPlease stay tuned as we roll out the new Skyclerk over the next few months. Of course, if you have any questions you can email me personally at spicer@skyclerk.com\nThank you!\n~Spicer\nSkyckerk - Founder\nP.S. If you visit skyclerk.com, you might notice some new pricing. We are very excited to lower the price of Skyclerk's offerings. I will address this change in our next blog post. Starting today, current customers will be charged the new price.\n","permalink":"https://skyclerk.com/blog/a-new-skyclerk-is-coming-today-we-release-a-new-site/","tags":null,"title":"A New Skyclerk is Coming - today we release a new site"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Sure is!\n You can download Skyclerk for IOS in the Apple App Store.
