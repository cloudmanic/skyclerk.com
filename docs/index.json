Today, we have tens of thousands of users and have grown month over month since the day we launched, without any help from a venture capitalist or outside\n\tfunding.\n\t As many of you may know, Skyclerk’s parent company is Cloudmanic Labs.\n\tMany years ago, we at Cloudmanic Labs got a little arrogant. We figured the Cloudmanic brand would resonate through the Internet.\n\tIf you purchased one Cloudmanic product, you would want all our software. So instead of marketing Skyclerk as a company in its own right, we kept Skyclerk under the Cloudmanic Labs umbrella. This was a mistake. Starting today, we are taking our\n\tfirst steps to spin Skyclerk off into its own entity free from Cloudmanic’s branding and such. \n\nWe got so wrapped up in building different products, (most of which gained no traction or success), we forgot to put our customer first.\n\nWith the early success, we assumed we could build a suite of software products and everyone would love them, but we overlooked one very very important thing: you, the customer. We got so wrapped up in building different products, (most of which\n\tgained no traction or success), we forgot to put our customer first. Our branding was confusing, our customer support was not helpful, and we failed to improve Skyclerk to support the changing times. That all changes today!\n\nWhat is changing?\n\nSkyclerk is still a product of Cloudmanic Labs but for our end users, this means nothing. Cloudmanic is just a holding company – a way to organize our business for tax and employment\n\tpurposes. For matters which are important to our customers, Skyclerk will operate like an independent company. \n\nToday, you can no longer find Skyclerk under the cloudmanic.com domain. If you want to learn about Skyclerk, you simply visit skyclerk.com. You no longer have to navigate\n\tall the other Cloudmanic products or be confused as to what options trading has to do with freelancer accounting. \n\n\n\nFor at least a month or two, you will still access your Skyclerk account via https://skyclerk.cloudmanic.com but soon, that will be changing as well. The Skyclerk app will be moving to a new skyclerk.com\n\tsub-domain. More on this in a few weeks. \n\nThis is the biggest benefit to our customers. We now have a faster, more flexible codebase.\n\nUnder the hood, there has been a fair amount of work to break the Skyclerk codebase away from the shared Cloudmanic Labs infrastructure. This is the biggest benefit to our customers. We now have a faster, more flexible codebase. We are going to\n\tbe able to iterate much faster and no longer be slowed down by the needs of other Cloudmanic software products. \n\nLastly, we are doing away with the distractions our teams have faced in the past. In the past, our team worked on all the different Cloudmanic software products. This made the team “a jack of all trades but a master of none”. As we spin Skyclerk\n\tout, we will have a dedicated team just for Skyclerk. No more distractions. We will be thinking about how to make bookkeeping and accounting better, faster, and less complex for freelancers every day from now on.\n\nMy thoughts as the founder of Skyclerk\n\nI could not be more excited about this change. I started building Skyclerk in 2004 to solve my own needs. In fact, I never had plans to release it to the world, but when I did, I realized how many solo entrepreneurs and freelancers needed\n\taccounting/bookkeeping software tailored to them. Bloatware products such as Quickbooks and Xero are overwhelming and unnecessary for smaller businesses.\n\nI could not be prouder or happier to share this news with you all. By simplifying and focusing the Skyclerk team, we are going to be able to continue to remove the annoyance of bookkeeping and accounting for our customers in new ways. \n\nTo our current customers, thank you for supporting us over the years. We plan to wow you in new ways, going forward.\n\nPlease stay tuned as we roll out the new Skyclerk over the next few months. Of course, if you have any questions you can email me personally at spicer@skyclerk.com\n\nThank you!\n\n~SpicerSkyckerk - Founder\n\nP.S. If you visit skyclerk.com, you might notice some new pricing. We are very excited to lower the price of Skyclerk's offerings. I will address this change in our next blog post. Starting today, current customers will be charged the new price.\n",

We are now offering Skyclerk for $6 a month or $60 when you pay for an entire year at once. Current customers will be billed this new price starting today.\n\n\n\n\nSaying Good-Bye to our Free Account\n\nYes, everything has a catch in this world -- to make our new pricing possible, we have decided to sunset our free account offering. Starting today, Skyclerk is no longer offering a free account. Every new customer will have 15 days to try out\n\tSkyclerk risk-free (no credit card required). Current customers using Skyclerk’s free accounts will have until October 1st, 2019 to upgrade.\n\nWe feel our new pricing is so low that not grandfathering in our free customers is acceptable. With that said, if you are using Skyclerk in a particular way that only a free account makes sense please reach out to us at help@skyclerk.com.\n\tWe promise to be fair and reasonable -- we will find a way to make things right. There is nothing worse than a software provider changing their terms after you have invested so much time in the platform. We get that, and we will try our best to\n\tmake things right with legacy customers who have never had a need to upgrade. However, we will do this on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWe promise to be fair and reasonable -- we will find a way to make things right. \n\nAs a side note, we will continue to support our non-profit, and young bootstrapped startup customers with free accounts. Please just reach out to us.\n\nWhy the Price Changes? Are you all on Drugs? \n\nWhen we launched Skyclerk nearly 9 years ago, we wanted to offer a free account. We thought it was important for customers to start recording income and expenses from day one before their business had any real revenue. So many entrepreneurs start\n\tkeeping good accounting books way too late when starting a business. If Skyclerk was free to use, everyone would start keeping good books from day one, right? We still believe this, and, although it saddens us that we need to put this goal aside\n\tfor a greater goal, we are quite excited about the possibilities this change will bring to Skyclerk\n\nAs it turns out, we get a fair number of new free customers every week. New customers often need help onboarding and getting to know Skyclerk. We really appreciate their eagerness to learn a new tool, and we love helping our new customers out,\n\tbut we are a small company - which means we have limits. The extra workload of our free customers was distracting us from providing world-class support for our paying customers. We also found when customers pay, they tend to be a bit more committed\n\tto our software. Many times, we have spent hours helping a free customer get to know Skyclerk only to have them jump ship. Skyclerk is not for everyone. \n\n\n\nWe want to focus on those who love our product and we think the best way to do that is to charge all customers. We get it. Everyone hates accounting/bookkeeping. Why make the pain worse with expensive software too? With our new super low pricing,\n\twe hope to keep Skyclerk at a range that is nothing more than a rounding error for any size company. \n\nFor the price of a cup of coffee, you can have Skyclerk every month.\n\nTo make that happen, the crack marketing team here at Skyclerk wanted a price that would allow us to be cheesy and say, “for the price of a cup of coffee you can have Skyclerk every month”! They researched for months to find a solution. Finally,\n\tthey determined all software should be priced based on “a cup of coffee” ... Nah, just joking… we don’t have a marketing team :). \n\nHow can you Charge So Little for Skyclerk?\n\nAs we enter our 9th year in business as one of the simplest - yet most robust - bookkeeping software on the market, we have become a bit nostalgic. Skyclerk was originally written by one computer nerd\n\theld up in his spare bedroom. We gained our first 1,000 customers without much outside help, and we have never accepted a penny of outside investment. We are very proud of how much we have been able to accomplish with such a lean team over the\n\tyears. \n\n\n\nAbout a year ago we were thinking about growing the Skyclerk team and, as a result, pricing would necessarily raise. This is a common pattern of most software providers. Prey on early customers to find product/market\n\t\tfit then increase prices in an attempt to scale and take over the world. Admittedly, we thought that way for a while, but it soon dawned on us: Why not go in the other direction? Why do we need to expand our team to take over the world when we\n\thave already proven we can do so much with so little? We think we can continue our growth and only get from our customers what we need to run the business and earn a healthy (but modest) profit. Hence our new pricing.\n\nWe hope everyone cheers our new prices and understands our decision to discontinue our free plan. As we mentioned in our last blog post it is a new day\n\tfor Skyclerk, and our new pricing is just an early step in making sure our coming years are as successful and customer-focused as our past years.\n",

But hurry, they are going fast. If you have already applied, please sit back and enjoy the rest of this post. \n\nIf you are like me, a form of depression is coming on fast. The year 2020 started off so promising and now it has gone to hell with no clear end in sight. Sales are down, making payroll is a real worry, and all your exciting business goals for\n\t2020 are postponed indefinitely. Furthermore, that rainy day savings account has dropped considerably due to the stock market tanking. \n\n\n\nWhat should we as business owners do during this time to stay upbeat and not sacrifice this time with depressive thoughts? Here are some suggestions from our customers, and personal changes I have made to help weather this storm.\n\n\n\tChange Your Routine. We are all stuck at home. We are all worried. It is very easy to get brought down by the thought of “same shit different day”. This is not an uplifting mindset. I have made an effort to change up my routine\n\t\tnearly every day. I start my mornings differently, I read different things, I work on different tasks in unorthodox ways and end my days differently. I have found keeping things new and different has fought off the depressive thoughts that kept me\n\t\tfrom charging forward.\n\tUse This Time to Zoom Out. Our economy has been in a massive bull market since March of 2009. Most of us have been chasing one great opportunity after another -- #Winning\n\t\tevery day! When times are good we often forget to zoom out. In the last few weeks, I have reviewed all my long term goals with Skyclerk and have realized many of these goals were not well thought out or did not\n\t\thave optimal ROIs. I think this zoomed out review process will pay bigger dividends in the long run. There is something exhilarating about a renewed focus.\n\tGo on Vacation. Well, not really. We are not allowed to leave our houses, but take a break from life. One restaurant owner I know has taken this opportunity to have downtime. He explained to me he has not had a vacation since\n\t\t2012 -- before he opened his restaurant. He told me he is reading more, catching up on TV, and doing house projects he never thought he would do. He is totally putting aside his business - for now. He hopes this time will supercharge his business\n\t\tefforts when he is allowed to open back up again.\n\tWork on the Bottom of your Todo List. A contractor customer of ours explained to me that with his newfound downtime he is working on stuff he has never had the time to get to. He used the example of opening an Instagram\n\t\taccount. Some of us might laugh and think how hard it is but when you are a contractor out in the field all day, finding computer time, and the time to upload content can be challenging. His hope is when we emerge from this Covid-19 mess he will\n\t\tbe better positioned to win contracts. He sees this time as an opportunity to focus on things he has struggled to do for years.\n\tTake Care of Your Customers and Employees. A lot of us have been so focused on growth since the last downturn we have forgotten to take extra good care of our customers and team members. Growth is on hold for the moment. Let’s\n\t\tfocus on what we have. Reach out to your customers and thank them, see if there is anything you can do for them during this time. Spend extra time with your team to learn what their needs and wants are. Maybe this is a time to support an employee\n\t\tto learn something new, or work on something outside of their day-to-day activities. I think many of us will be judged by how we treated our customers and employees during this time. Those of us who did right by them will likely have a leg up in\n\t\tthe future. Wait, what does this suggestion have to do with the fighting of depression? Simply put, it moves your focus to something positive and hopefully motivating.\n\n\nThe Internet is crowded with these types of posts -- “How people should survive the Covid-19 recession”. I am fully aware everything I suggested is not some new mind-blowing concept. My primary goal was to be one more voice saying you are not\n\talone. Business owners everywhere are struggling, not just financially but emotionally. Freelancers and small business owners are worried, but as they say, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.\n",

At my\n\tdaughter’s school, there are limited parking spots in close proximity to the front door while the rest of the parking spots require lugging my daughter across a sometimes busy parking lot. Morning dropoff is stressful, to say the least, we are\n\talways late, my kids never cooperate, and there are always multiple belongings that need to make it into the classroom or a four-year-old meltdown is inevitable. As I am tracking\n\tacross the parking lot there is one thing I always notice -- the owner of the school has parked her car in a prime front row parking spot. \n\nEven on 30 below zero days with 3 feet of fresh snow on the ground, he would not waver and park any closer to the front door. \n\nMy father was an insurance agent with his office in a big 3 story office mall. The parking lot for this building must have had room for 500 cars and almost never completely filled up but my father made a point to always park as far away from the\n\tfront door as possible. Even on 30 below zero days with 3 feet of fresh snow on the ground, he would not waver and park any closer to the front door. At a young age, I asked him why he parked so far away and he told me the experience his customers\n\thave while visiting him was very important to him and it started when they pulled into the parking lot. In his view, they should have front row parking. \n\n\n\nObsessing with Customer’s Experience is a Win\n\nWant to take your small business and turn it into a big business? Then obsess over experience. This is not a new concept, Jeff Bezos has been preaching this for years through his customer-focused\n\tculture at Amazon, but this is something most business owners tend to neglect or are not detail-oriented enough for. \n\nIn another example, there is a plaza near where I work that has a number of eating options but my preferred is a sandwich place at the far end of the building. When I pull in I often look for parking in front, if there is not I might need to go\n\tto the opposite end of the plaza to find parking. While walking to the sandwich shop I pass by 3 other places to eat. I almost never make it to the sandwich shop. I always convince myself to try something different before getting to the front door\n\tof my go-to lunch spot. Something I recently observed is the owner stops by most days during lunchtime to support his team during rush hour. Guess where he parks? Right in front. His choice to park upfront cost him the $15 I was about to spend that\n\tday. Had I gotten his parking spot I would not have been tempted by other offerings. \n\n\n\nMy guess is both the sandwich shop owner and the daycare owner were far too consumed with countless other concerns a small business often has to even notice the negative impact they had on their customers and revenue. As a small business\n\tentrepreneur, it is nearly impossible to prioritize everything but one simple thing has always made my life better as a business owner: more revenue. I have found if I focus on delighting my customers, revenue will follow, and the rest of my day to\n\tday worries will be far easier to manage. \n\nCustomer Experience is All About the Little Things\n\nThe examples above are small. I am sure no business will succeed or fail based on where the owner parks. Still, these subtle things can add up and subconsciously turn customers off. I tend to notice these things, thanks to my father. Other\n\tcustomers, however, may not, and they could be turned off without even realizing it. A different person might stop eating at the sandwich shop without ever defining why they are discouraged. I think many business owners do not consider the\n\tsubconscious effects on how they manage their business. \n\nOne of the earliest interactions with a customer is to signal a lack of trust. The bartender is suggesting the customer will leave without paying.\n\nHave you ever walked into a bar and the bartender asks for and holds your credit card while opening a tab? This is a very negative and I submit it is often poor business practice. In this example, one of the earliest interactions with a customer\n\tis to signal a lack of trust. The bartender is suggesting the customer will leave without paying. It would be one thing if the bar was making the customer’s life easier so when they were done they could simply walk out effortlessly paying the bill\n\tbut that is not the typical case. I understand some bars have issues with people “dining and dashing”, so a bar owner has to weigh the pros and cons - but few realize there are cons that should be deeply considered. \n\n\n\nFor my last example, have you ever noticed some subscription businesses make it very hard to discontinue the service? Canceling the service might lead to a great deal of time on the phone going from department to department. Some entrepreneurs\n\tthink this is a strategy to save the customer. In reality, it is a great way to ensure a customer never comes back and likely does not recommend the company to others. This approach is trading short term greed for long term growth. A leader\n\tobsessed with customer experience would make sure canceling their service is painless as it will likely lead to revenue in other ways -- counterintuitive right? \n\nAs a rule of thumb business owners should be primarily focused on delighting their customers in any way possible. The customer experience is often the key to sustained long term\n\tgrowth. Every subtle interaction should be closely optimized for customer enchantment, and a decision as simple as where to park your car can subconsciously attract or detract a customer.\n",

We were saying goodbye to the Cloudmanic\n\t\tLabs umbrella and taking on the world as just Skyclerk. Today, I would like to announce Skycerk 3.0 is here and better than ever! \n\n\n\nAs part of this transition, we did a complete rewrite of Skyclerk -- meaning every line of code has been rewritten. Even though everything has changed under the hood, the Skyclerk that you know and love remains mostly the same (with a few\n\tupgrades). \n\nSkyclerk is crazy fast now!\n\nThe biggest and most notable change is that Skyclerk is crazy fast now. Without a doubt, we are the fastest bookkeeping software on the market. Accounting is never fun, and waiting for your software to “think” just adds frustration. It is our\n\tmission to never waste a second of your time with slow software. \n\nJust Give Me the Highlights \n\nYes, we know product update announcements can be boring and self-aggrandizing so here is what you need to know. \n\n\n\tSkyclerk is 100% free until February 2020. After that, it will be $6.00 a month. Current customers will be prompted to enter in their credit card numbers again.\n\tIf you had set your currency to something other than US dollars you will have to update your currency again. Here is a support document showing you how to fix\n\t\tit.\n\tWe moved the Contacts section of Skyclerk to the Settings area. It makes room for future improvements.\n\tThe Skyclerk 3.0 is designed for iteration. If you have any suggestions or feedback please let us know by emailing us at help@skyclerk.com.\n\n\nI want to know more… what are the deets?\n\nOnce you log into Skyclerk 3.0, you will notice some subtle changes. Along with a revamped new dashboard, we moved the Contacts, Categories, and Labels into Settings. These user interface changes give us many more options for future growth --\n\tInvoicing is coming soon.\n\nAnother big change is that Skyclerk will to longer offer a free version. We explained this move in more detail in our Cheapest Bookkeeping Software on the Market\n\tblog post. Simply put, we felt that our efforts to support non-paying customers were taking away from our paying customers -- How is this fair? To make up for this change we reduced the cost of Skyclerk to $6.00 a month or $60.00 per year.\n\nSkyclerk is free to everyone until February 1st, 2020.\n\n\nTo give our customers time to adjust to the new pricing, Skyclerk is free to everyone until February 1st, 2020. At this point, all customers will have to reenter their credit card number. We updated our payments system as part of Skyclerk 3.0,\n\twhich means we also deleted all past customer credit card numbers. \n\nLastly, the changes caused the currency settings for our international customers to be blown away, and all Skyclerk accounts to be back to being US dollar-based. However, we made sure to offer a very easy process to change this back by following\n\tthe directions outlined here. \n\nOur Roadmap Going Forward\n\nThe number one reason for all this change is that after 9 years Skyclerk had become stale. We found innovation to Skyclerk to be cumbersome and slow. With Skyclerk 3.0, we are looking forward to the new and exciting future that Skyclerk can have.\n\tFor 2020, we are planning to integrate auto bank importing into Skyclerk, and finally launch an invoicing feature. Along with these two innovations, we plan to continue to improve our existing offering. Keep an eye on your inbox and our blog to\n\tfollow along with our new path forward.\n\nSkyclerk has been around for over 9 years!\n\nSkyclerk has been around and profitable for over 9 years. Customers from our very early days are still using Skyclerk every day. We could not be more thankful for the continued loyalty to Skyclerk.

Most accounting systems, banks, and spreadsheets allow you to export transactions as\n\ta CSV file. Once you have a CSV file it is very easy to import your ledger entries into Skyclerk by following these steps:\n\n\t1\n\t\tNavigate to your Ledger landing page in Skyclerk. Click the “Import Transactions” link in the right column.\n\t\n\t2\n\t\tClick the “Select Files” button and locate on your computer the CSV file you want to upload.\n\t\n\t3\n\t\tAfter the CSV file has been uploaded you will be directed to a preview of the first 5 ledger entries. Verify that the data columns align properly. If everything looks good click the “Confirm & Import” button to import the CSV transactions to\n\t\t\tyour Ledger in Skyclerk. (Check out this sample CSV file to see how the data columns need to be to align with\n\t\t\tSkyclerk.)\n\t\n\nA Few Guidelines for Setting Up Your CSV File\n\n\tNegative amounts will be considered expenses and positive amounts will be considered income.\n\tCommas must be removed from amounts: “10,000,000.00” should be “10000000.00”.\n\tAmounts must be in dollar format: “100,33” should be “100.33”.\n\tCurrency symbols must be removed from amounts: “$12.33” should be “12.33”.\n\nAll of these changes can be made by formatting the column containing the numbers in the CSV file.\nNeed More Help?\nCheck out our tutorial video on importing ledger entries from a CSV file. \n\n",
