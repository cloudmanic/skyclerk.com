Public marketing site for Skyclerk.

# Development Notes

* `npx tailwindcss build assets/css/style.css -o assets/css/build.css`

* `hugo server -D`


# Github Pages

To support github pages we build to `docs` instead of a `public` directory.


# Content Tricks

* When you add `<!--more-->` in your blog post it breaks up the post and that is what we use as the summary.
