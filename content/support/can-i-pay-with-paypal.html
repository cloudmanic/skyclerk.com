<p>You can pay yearly with PayPal. Afraid we do not provide an option for monthly billing. In order to pay with PayPal simply click one of the buttons below. Please use the email address associated with your Skyclerk account. If you end up using a
	different one please email us at <a href="mailto:help@skyclerk.com">help@skyclerk.com</a> and let us know you did. </p>
<p>PayPal payments can take 24 hours to go through. If you are currently locked out of your account for non-payment please email <a href="mailto:help@skyclerk.com">help@skyclerk.com</a> and we can manually let you back in. </p>
