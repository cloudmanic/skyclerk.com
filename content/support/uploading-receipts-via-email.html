<p>A convenient feature of Snap!Clerk is the ability to upload receipts via email. Simply attach a receipt image to an email and send it to a unique, secure email address linked to your <a href="https://skyclerk.com">Skyclerk</a> account. The image
	will be processed just like any receipt you upload using the <a href="http://cloudmanic.com/blog/74/snapclerk-upload-receipts-on-the-go">Snap!Clerk</a> mobile phone or web interface.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://app.skyclerk.com/snapclerk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://app.skyclerk.com/snapclerk</a> to obtain your Snap!Clerk email address (see below). If it is ever compromised by a spammer, just email <a href="mailto:help@skyclerk.com">help@skyclerk.com</a>
	and we will create a new Snap!Clerk email address for you.</p>

<p>Currently Snap!Clerk accepts only images of receipts, which are analyzed and accurately entered into your Skyclerk ledger. The subject of your email is entered as the ledger entry note. </p>
<p>Soon you will also be able to submit receipts as PDF files and text emails. <br></p>
