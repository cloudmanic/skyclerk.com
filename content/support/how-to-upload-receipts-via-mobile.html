	In the video below we show you how to upload Snap!Clerk receipts via our <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skyclerk-bookkeeping-and-accounting/id483718116">IOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudmanic.skyclerk">Android</a>
	mobile applications.
</p>

<p>
	With Snap!Clerk you simply take a picture of a receipt and our system extracts the information creating a ledger entry for you.

<p>
	One of the best features of Snap!Clerk is you just have to write on the receipt your desired category or labels. If you do this our system will make sure your ledger entry always matches. Of course this is optional. Our system will select the best
	category for you if you do not write anything.
</p>

<p>
	To add a label simply put the "#" in front of the label when writting it on your receipt. For example "#Remodel" will make sure the ledger entry is assigned the label of remodel.
