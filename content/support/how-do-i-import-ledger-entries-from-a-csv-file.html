<p>One of the most useful <a href="http://skyclerk.cloudmanic.com">Skyclerk</a> features for new users is the ability to import past ledger entries via a CSV file. Most accounting systems, banks, and spreadsheets allow you to export transactions as
	a CSV file. Once you have a CSV file it is very easy to import your ledger entries into Skyclerk by following these steps:</p>
<ul class="steps">
	<li><span class="num">1</span>
		<p>Navigate to your Ledger landing page in Skyclerk. Click the “Import Transactions” link in the right column.</p><img src="http://assets1.cloudmanic.com/blog/10-28-2012/screenshot-01.jpg" alt="importing transactions step #1" width="630"
		 data-image="zbnbv96n8lsp">
	</li>
	<li><span class="num">2</span>
		<p>Click the “Select Files” button and locate on your computer the CSV file you want to upload.</p><img src="http://assets1.cloudmanic.com/blog/10-28-2012/screenshot-02.jpg" alt="importing transactions step #2" width="630" data-image="dm59d2fv4pfc">
	</li>
	<li><span class="num">3</span>
		<p>After the CSV file has been uploaded you will be directed to a preview of the first 5 ledger entries. Verify that the data columns align properly. If everything looks good click the “Confirm & Import” button to import the CSV transactions to
			your Ledger in Skyclerk. (Check out this <a href="http://assets1.cloudmanic.com/blog/10-28-2012/skyclerk-ledger-import-example.csv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sample CSV file</a> to see how the data columns need to be to align with
			Skyclerk.)</p><img src="http://assets1.cloudmanic.com/blog/10-28-2012/screenshot-03.jpg" alt="importing transactions step #2" width="630" data-image="psyskrh1ssoi">

</ul>
<h3>A Few Guidelines for Setting Up Your CSV File</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Negative amounts will be considered expenses and positive amounts will be considered income.</li>
	<li>Commas must be removed from amounts: “10,000,000.00” should be “10000000.00”.</li>
	<li>Amounts must be in dollar format: “100,33” should be “100.33”.</li>
	<li>Currency symbols must be removed from amounts: “$12.33” should be “12.33”.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these changes can be made by formatting the column containing the numbers in the CSV file.</p>
