<p>
	We don’t have an iPad app. Instead, we recommend that you access Skyclerk from your iPad’s web browser app, just like you would on a computer. Our iPhone app can be used on an iPad, but the size and layout are designed specifically for an iPhone so
	it doesn’t look ideal on the larger iPad screen.
