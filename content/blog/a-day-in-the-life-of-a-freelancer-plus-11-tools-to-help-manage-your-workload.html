<p>Are you a freelancer? Or do you consider yourself a solopreneur or gig worker?</p>

<p>Whether you’re writing blog posts late at night and on the weekends like I am, or you run your construction business out of your truck, your day is jam-packed with everything from your actual work to balancing your ledger and handling customer
	service. </p>

<p>And as more businesses shift toward remote and workers look for more flexible work arrangements, the need to be as efficient as possible has never been higher.</p>

<h2>The 21st Century and the Seismic Shift to Remote Working</h2>

<p>Leading up to 2020, the gig economy was booming forward with more and more organizations embracing freelancers to complete work in various departments. Today <a href="https://cultureiq.com/blog/types-work-flexibility-employees/">
		4 in 5 workers</a> consider a flexible work arrangement the most important factor when determining a job offer or staying at their current company.</p>

<p>And then the COVID-19 global pandemic hit the western hemisphere in March 2020, leading to stay-at-home orders and companies shifting to remote working for most corporate and non-essential positions. These two forces combine to form the future of
	work, where companies see the cost-savings opportunities and employees enjoy the flexibility to work from home. At the end of March,<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-04-03-gartner-cfo-surey-reveals-74-percent-of-organizations-to-shift-some-employees-to-remote-work-permanently2?utm_source=Triggermail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Post%2520Blast%2520bii-connectivity-and-tech:%2520Work%2520from%2520home%2520becoming%2520the%2520new%2520normal%2520%257C%2520Apple%2527s%2520iPhone%2520affordability%2520focus%2520will%2520help%2520fuel%25202020%2520shipments%2520%257C%2520Global%2520smartphone%2520shipments%2520contract%252013%2525%2520YoY%2520in%2520Q1%25202020&utm_term=BII%2520List%2520Connectivity%2520ALL">

<p>One common thread between these types of jobs include the ability to work remotely using online tools and cloud software. Additionally, some of these jobs can be done outside of business hours. </p>

<h2>Tools for Freelancers</h2>

<h3>Productivity</h3>

<p>With freelancing or working from home full-time, it’s easy to get distracted by overflowing email inboxes, social media, and the constant notifications on our smartphones. A few tips to help with this include setting a schedule and creating a
	dedicated workspace to ensure you’re focused on work. (No, your bed isn’t your office.)</p>

<img src="images/blog/do-more-on-imac.jpg" alt="Do More On Imac" />

<p>Another way to become more productive is to use a simple project management tool to help keep track of your time, projects, and set deadlines for yourself or others on your team. Trello is a simple project management tool that offers a<a href="https://trello.com/pricing">
		free version</a> that allows freelancers or small businesses to manage projects on a corkboard with cards and checklists. You can also integrate the tool with cloud-based programs like Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>

<h3>Business operations</h3>

<p>Although ‘free’ is the prefix of the word freelancer, there are quite a few rules and regulations that freelancers should follow when conducting business for tax and legal purposes.</p>

<p>Skyclerk is an app that provides business owners and freelancers<a href="https://skyclerk.com/"> a simple bookkeeping ledger</a> for balancing revenue and expenses on-the-go. This is especially useful for freelancers or jobs outside of the office
	or with frequent travel. </p>

<p>Stripe is an online tool and app for<a href="https://stripe.com/billing"> collecting online payments</a> and managing customer invoices and billing information. You can schedule reminders to encourage clients to complete outstanding payments for
	services, track revenue with built-in reporting, and even set up automatic recurring payments.</p>

<h2>Is the Freelance Life Right for You?</h2>

<p>It’s true. There are several reasons to have a side hustle: Supplement or diversify your income, expand your skill set, and unleash creativity. But whatever you’re reasoning, you should be prepared to cover the additional work needed to manage
	your side hustle like its own business. </p>

<p>When it comes to determining whether freelancing is right for you, test it out first with a side gig or two to balance your work and get comfortable. </p>
